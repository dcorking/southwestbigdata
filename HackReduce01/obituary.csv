25/06/1921,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr James Baker,"Death of Mr Jas. Baker\r\n\r\nWell-Known Author and Journalist\r\n\r\nUnique Experiences\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death of Mr James Baker, the well-known author and journalist of 1 Goldney Road, Clifton. He recently went on an expedition to Bohemia, but a sudden illness caused him to return, and unfortunately it has proved fatal.\r\nMr James Baker, who was born in January, 1847, was educated by his father who was successively schoolmaster, secretary of Clifton College, and founder of the well-known publishing business in Clifton. Whilst associated with the firm, Mr James Baker launched out in journalistic work, and as a special correspondent wrote articles for newspapers and magazines. He travelled a great deal on the continent, visiting  Greece, Russia and other countries. He made a special study of  Bohemia, and was awarded the Great Silver Medal of Prague by the Senate for his literary work. He lectured in London and elsewhere on Egypt, Russia, and Palestine, and became an enthusiast on the  importance of technical education. In 1889 he travelled in Tunis and Sicilly, and studied technical and commercial education in Prussia, Poland, Galicia,  and Bohemia and wrote for the Education Department a report which was published officially. He was in Georgia and Palestine in 1903; Bohemia, 1905; Spain, 1906-09; Bosnia, 1907; Bukovina, 1911; and was the guest of the City of Prague at the Palackv and Sokol  Commemoration in 1912. Mr Baker was a successful author as well as journalist. He began in 1879 with Poems and Translations, and two years later he produced 'Days Afoot and European Sketches.' Some of his more important work include 'John Westacott,' 1886; 'By the Western Sea,' 1889; 'Our Foreign Competitors,' 1892; 'Mark Tillotson,' 1892; 'A  Forgotten Great Englishman,' 1894; 'Pictures From Bohemia,' 1894; 'The Gleaming Dawn,' 1896; 'The Cardinal's Page,' 1898;  'A Double Choice,' 1901; 'The Inseparables,' 1905; 'Austria - Her People and Their Homelands,' 1912; 'Reminiscent Gossip of Men and Matters,' 1913.\r\nIn view of his wide and frequent travels and his numerous writings, it is not surprising that Mr Baker was honoured aboard as well as at home.  He was a knight of the Imperial Order of Francis Joseph (Austria),  1908; F.R.G.S., F.R. Hist. Society, corresponding member of the Royal Academy of Arts, Madrid, 1911; British Secretary of the International  Association of Journalists, 1906; a member of the Savage and Authors' Clubs, London, and of the University Club, Bristol; and of the Bristol Branch of the Institute of Journalists and of the Bristol and West of  England Press Fund. He was a member of the Council of the Bristol Branch of the Colonial Institute, in whose affairs he took a keen interest.\r\nA man of genial disposition, he was excellent company. He had a  budget of most interesting and unique experiences that he had met with during his travels as a special correspondent to different capitals of the world for events of historic and international importance. Early in 1913 Mr Baker suffered a severe bereavement by the death of his son, Major Sidney Baker, aged 37, of the Gloucestershire Regiment. He had distinguished himself brilliantly in action, which ended in an order for withdrawal. As the officer in temporary command he was the  last to leave the redoubt, and just as he was nearing safety he was hit by a bullet which killed him instantaneously. His son had shown much ability as a scholar, linguist, and lecturer. A biography of him by his father was his last work, and is now in the press. Only a few days ago we announced that Mr James Baker had recently returned from his expedition to Bohemia where in Prague he found  intense propaganda being carried on by Vatican and German agents to  belittle the Czechs and to create distrust with them and the British, this  work vigorously invading our official circles. He was met most cordially by the President of the New Republic, M. Marsarvk,  and by most of the officers of the State, and hoped to publish facts to counteract some of this evil, but the arduous journey developed an illness long threatening, which unfortunately has cost him his life. The funeral is arranged for Monday next, and there will be a service at Christ Church, Clifton, at 2 o'clock.",

19/01/1920,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Albert Edward Tilling,"Death of Mr A. E.

Rather more than two years ago Mr Tilling underwent a serious operation for cancer. Last year there was a reoccurrence of the trouble, and as the sight affected was in the liver, a second operation was deemed inadvisable. Mr Tilling has been an acute sufferer since last June, during which period he became gradually weaker. His condition had been regarded as critical for some weeks past, so that the end early yesterday morning was not unexpected. He had attained the age of 56 years.\r\nMr A. E. Tilling was a Bristolian, and cherished a profound affection for his native city, of which his father was a Freeman. Born in College Green around  which so many literary associations cluster, Mr Tilling first became identified with the Bristol Public Libraries in 1879, when he took up a junior assistantship at one of the then few outposts - St. Philip's. Thence he was promoted to the quaint old Central Library in King Street - now evacuated - were he came under the inspiring guidance of the late Mr John Taylor. On the transference of the Museum Library to the city in 1895, Mr Tilling was there appointed sub-librarian, an office in which he continued for a decade when, on that library's amalgamation with the collection in Deanery Road, he was delegated to the supervision of the Fishponds branch. This was a temporary tenure, and Mr Tilling was soon recalled to the present Central Library. A conscientious and diligent student of library practice, Mr Tilling was able to snatch from routine duty sufficient time in which to engage in independent literary 'excursions'. Under the familiar 'nom-de-plume,' 'Stanley Hutton,' he has been a voluminous writer. Early efforts in verse, of which he was a tasteful exponent, gave place to ambitious work, and 'Stanley Hutton' achieved his first distinctive success with his volume 'Bristol and its Famous Associations,' published by Mr Arrowsmith.  This history, written from a fresh standpoint - that of purely personal - secured to him a prominent and abiding place in Bristol's literary annals. 'Stanley Hutton's' next outstanding performance in authorship was the concise 'History of Bath and Bristol' exquisitely illustrated in colour, and issued by B. and C. Black of London. But in the interval between the production of these books, 'Stanley Hutton' was responsible for many instructive articles based on his knowledge of Bristol and its lore in the columns of the local press  and also in the pages of high-class London weeklies. The signature of 'Stanley Hutton' has figured frequently and acceptably in the 'Western Daily Press' and the 'Bristol Observer.' In fact he made his first appearance in print with a poem in the 'Bristol Observer' during the editorship of that paper by Mr Falconer King (now a member of the editorial staff of the 'Western Daily Press') and in recognition of that fact the name of Mr King appears jointly with that of another gentleman in the dedication of one of Mr Tilling's books. 'Stanley Hutton's' studies of Bristol have been both wide and deep. Until quite lately he had been engaged on a new biography of Burke. Incidentally the artists whose historic pictures adorn he Bristol Council Chamber have been much indebted to his knowledge of Bristol's past for the historical fidelity of their canvases. He was also chosen as the adjudicator in a recent extensive essay competition on Bristol history. He was also well-known as a lecturer, his chief topic being the history of Bristol particularly in the 18th century, and  as these lectures were always illustrated with lantern slides, they were always extremely popular.  ",

Gardener, of Bristol, has just died suddenly at Surbiton at the age of 34 years. A war prisoner in Germany from December, 1914, until last year, he suffered privations which undoubtedly undermined his health, and he succumbed to heart failure. From his schools days at Clifton, he has always been a keen Rugby player and oarsman. On the outbreak of war he enlisted in the  Artists Rifles, and from that corps received a commission in the Queen's in December 1914; he was a prisoner in Germany for a long time, and  was repatriated last November. Rought's first essay on the Thames was in 1906, for the Bristol Ariel R.C., in a regatta at Reading, and he joined the Thames R.C. in 1907. The following year was one of extraordinary successes. He was in winning senior fours at the Metropolitan,  Kingston, Molesey, and Goring regattas, and in fours at Waiton. He also won his junior sculls at Marlow. From that year the successes,  particularly in fours, were frequently repeated. In 1911 he and Bruce Logan (bow) had a memorable dead-heat in the Pairs with J. Beresford and A. Hamilton Cloutie. This was in the fastest time on record for pairs, 8 min 8 sec. In the Olympic regatta of 1912, Rought was in  England's four in the final, but Germany had a good crew and they won, England's crew being unused to in-rigged fours with coxswains.

09/06/1919,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Sir Barclay J. Baron,"It is with the deepest regret we have to announce the death of Sir Barclay J. Baron which occurred early on Saturday morning. A few weeks ago Sir Barclay had the misfortune to slip in his garden at White Ladies Road and break a rib, but until recently he was making good progress to recovery. The serious complications that set in last week were known to but a few, so that the news of his death created a most painful surprise in the city on Saturday morning.\r\nSir Barclay Josiah Baron was one of Bristol's foremost citizens. It was not until 1913 that he became actively associated in municipal affairs.In November 1913, he was elected one of the representatives of the South Clifton Ward, and at once threw himself whole-heartedly into the business of the Corporation. He quickly became one of the most valued of members, and on the retirement of Alderman J. Swaish he was elected Lord Mayor of the city, serving her two years - 1915-1916 and 1916-1917 - with such distinction that in January, 1918, he received a knighthood. Sir Barclay gave his fellow citizens a splendid lead in effort for the common cause during the darkest days of the war. He was one of the first to come forward when there was a great need for recruiting zeal, and all through his term of office he worked tremendously hard, both in furthering recruiting and in caring for the wounded who were pouring into the city from the battlefields of France. He was a constant visitor to the hospitals, and for a long period met every ambulance train that came into the city with wounded soldiers. Thousands of soldiers now scattered over the country and Empire will gratefully recall his personal interest in their welfare and the memorable Christmas and other gatherings in which, as chairman of the Inquiry Bureau, he took the lead. His interest in the soldiers was also shown by his visits to Salisbury Plain, and few who were present at Larkhill on the eve of the departure for the front of a  Bristol Territorial Battalion will forget his stimulating address. He was founder of the Gallipoli celebration, the first gathering of survivors of this historic campaign taking place at the Mansion House, a celebration which has been kept up on the day of the landing during succeeding years. During his term of office Dr Barclay Baron had the honour of receiving the King and Queen, who came to this city and held an investiture on the Downs.\r\nOn his retirement from the Lord Mayoralty, the City Council adopted by acclamation a resolution heartily thanking him 'for the manner in which he had during his second term of office carried out the duties of Lord Mayor, for the skilful and dignified way in which he had presided over the deliberations of the Council, for the ability he had ever displayed in putting forward the interests of the city when important questions affecting the welfare of the citizens had been under consideration, for the readiness shown by him in associating himself with every movement rendered necessary by the circumstances of the war, and for his generous hospitality.'\r\n\r\nContinued in Well Doing\r\n\r\nAfter the signing of the armistice, Sir Barclay had devoted himself unselfishly to the cause of the demobilized soldier, and as chairman of the Labour Advisory Committee worked increasingly to help in solving a very difficult and deplorable problem. His sympathy with the men who had fought and on returning to civil life could not find a job was unbounded, and that the problem locally is still unsolved is certainly not due to the lack of endeavour by the Advisory Committee. Sir Barclay was held in high esteem by representatives of Labour, and not long ago he was called upon to act as arbitrator in a very important matter affecting two trade unions.\r\nThe deceased knight was a native of Devonshire, but he spent the major part of his life in this city, where he gained considerable eminence in the medical profession. He studied for that profession at Edinburgh University where he was the first graduate of his year and won the Ertles Scholarship in 1881. He also secured the prize for surgery and the medals for natural history. He passed all his examinations with distinction and held the degree of M.B. and C.M. After leaving the University he continued his studies in Bristol, Strasbourg and Vienna. It was in 1883 that Sir Barclay came to Bristol and commenced to practise, and a year later he founded the department for the treatment of the nose and throat at the General Hospital which  he directed for 18 years. Then owing to the increase in his private practice he resigned the position, and was appointed one of the consulting physicians. He was president of the Bristol branch of the Medical Association, and was associated with many other societies in Bristol, having occupied the presidential chair of the Caledonian Society and the Society of Devonians in Bristol.\r\n\r\nArt and Drama\r\n\r\nThe late Sir Barclay Baron was a keen patron of art and drama. He took a leading part in forming the Bristol Playgoers' Club, of which he became chairman. In his capacity as specialist in throat and ear affections Sir Barclay was a great friend to many theatrical and music hall artists visiting this city, to whom he gave the benefit of his professional skill readily and freely.\r\nIn pre-war times Sir Barclay Baron was a regular subscriber to the Bristol and West of England Press Fund, and generally attended its annual banquet. A staunch Conservative, he was a member of the Constitutional Club, as well as of various political organisations. He was a keen supporter of educational effort.\r\nA man of genial and cheerful disposition, well read and widely  experienced Sir Barclay Baron was excellent company, and was heartily welcomed alike in civic and social circles. There was no more popular member of the Constitutional Club or of the Commercial Rooms, and he exercised considerable influences in the City, being always ready, by act or word, to help a good cause. He was about sixty-five years of age, and a man of remarkable vitality.\r\nWith Lady Baron and her son and three daughters, the deepest sympathy will be felt. The public life of Bristol is much the poorer for the passing of Sir Barclay Baron, and throughout the city his lose will be keenly felt.",
21/01/1888,Bristol Times and Mirror,Obituary,Mr William Henry Miles,"We regret to announce the death of Mr. William Henry Miles, of Ham Green, Leigh, a partner in the firm of Miles, Cave, Baillie, and Co., bankers of this city. So late as Saturday, in 7th instant, Mr. Miles was at the bank in Corn-Street, when he complained of suffering from a severe cold. This subsequently turned into pleurisy, and developed into inflammation of the lungs, from which unhappily the patient was unable to rally. The deceased gentleman was the second son of the late Sir William Miles, of Leigh Court, by Catherine, daughter of Mr. John Gordon, and was born in 1830. His father for many years represented East Somerset in Parliament, and was, in recognition of his political consistency and genuine worth, created a baronet in 1859, Earl Derby at the time being Prime Minister. Mr W. H. Miles filled the office of High Sheriff for the city and county of Bristol in 1866-7, and for a period of nearly twenty years - from 1868 to 1886 - he sat in the Town Council as one of the representatives of the Central Ward of the city. In 1874 he served as president of the Dolphin Society, when he succeeded in collecting Â£1121 16s 1d., a sum which up to that time had only been surpassed on one occasion. He received his education at Eton and Balliol College Oxford, and at the latter place, in 1851, he took his B.A. degree. In 1862 he married Mary Frances, only daughter of the Rev. John Kynaston Charleton, formerly vicar of Elberton, Gloucestershire. The deceased gentleman took an active part in some local matters, and at the time of his death was chairman of the Ashton Vale Iron Company, and also chairman of the Bristol and West of England Canadian Land Mortgage Company, and vice-chairman of the Bristol Royal Infirmary. He was interested too, in local works of a philanthropic character, being treasurer, amongst other societies, of the Nurses' Training Institution and Home, in Richmond-terrace, Clifton. Mr Miles was long connected with the North Somerset Yeomanry, of which he was formerly captain; and he also acted for many years as Justice of the Peace for the same county. Mr Miles, who, we need hardly say, was,like all the members of his family, a staunch Conservative in politics, took an active part in our local Parliamentary contests, and was earnestly attached to the Established Church, up to the time of his death acting as treasurer to the fund for re-establishing the Bristol Bishopric. The loss occasioned by the death of this respected gentleman will be very severely felt in his own immediate neighbourhood. Naturally of a benevolent disposition, he, without ostentation,  largely assisted his poorer neighbours, many of whom, not only in our own city, but especially in the parishes of Pill and St. George, have lost in him a warm-hearted and generous friend. Mr Miles suffered unfortunately from deafness, which gave the impression to those to whom he was not intimately known that he was somewhat of a reserved nature. But those who were intimate with him knew him to be one of the most genial and kind-hearted of men; and it is not too much to say that he was deeply beloved by his own family and by a large and appreciative circle of friends. His unexpected death has cast a gloom, not only over the whole parish of Leigh, but also in the city with which he and his family have been so long and honourably associated.",
19/12/1888,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr George Wills,"We regret to announce the death of Mr George Wills, J.P., last evening, at his residence, 3, Worcester Villas, College Road, Clifton. He had been suffering from heart disease for many years, but had taken great care of himself. During the last few days he was slightly indisposed, through a cold, but there seemed to be no cause for alarm. He sat on the bench at the police court on Saturday, and on Sunday attended service at the Cathedral. His physician was Dr John Beddoe, who happened to be visiting a patient at Mr Will's residence, and had his attention directed to the deceased, who felt unwell. Dr Beddoe ordered him to remain in the upper part of the house, and Mr Wills followed the direction of his medical advisor, but feeling better on Monday came downstairs. Yesterday Dr Beddoe saw him again, and ordered that he should remain in an upper apartment. At middle day he was in cheerful spirits, and up to five o'clock there seemed to be no fear of any fatal result, but soon after that hour he was seized with spasms of the heart, and expired. Dr Beddoe was immediately sent for, and went promptly, but before he reached the house Mr Wills was dead. The deceased gentleman was in his seventy-sixth year, and has left five daughters, one of whom is married and resides in London; another, married, resides in Birmingham; a third is the widow of Captain Caesar Hawkins, who had commanded the Daedalus and died a few months ago, being buried at Kelston near Bath. There are two daughters who reside at Worcester Villas. Mr Wills was considerably affected at the death of Captain Hawkins, who was married to Miss Wills only a few months. The brother of the deceased is Mr Samuel Wills, of the Castle Sugar Refinery. Mr George Wills was formerly in business in Bridge Street as a wine merchant, and he took great interest in the trade of the city as long as he remained a member of the Town Council, serving on some of the most important committees. When the redistribution of seats took place Mr Wills, who had been member for Bristol ward from 1866, was transferred in October, 1880, to St Philip's North, which he represented till his term expired in 1882. He was long closely identified with the Liberal Party and acted in the capacity as treasurer to the Liberal Registration Association, first when the offices were in Tailors' Court, Broad Street, and afterwards on the association removing its headquarters to Bridge Street. When the party became divided upon the Irish question Mr Wills joined the ranks of the Unionists. As a member of the Board of Charity Trustees he evinced considerable interest in the Grammar school, and from the time of his election as a trustee in 1875, he was constant in his attendance at the distribution of prizes. He was a great friend of Dr Caldicott, and after the reverend gentleman left Bristol the friendship continued, so that upon occasions when Dr Caldicott visited this city he invariably stayed at the residence of Mr Wills. Of refined tastes, the deceased was much interested in archaeology, and especially in the preservation of old buildings. He took an active part in endeavouring to preserve the fine Perpendicular archway at the entrance of Guard House Passage, Wine Street; but the Council having in 1880 given its consent to the closing of the passage, the owner of the adjoining property having offered to open a more convenient thoroughfare, the arch was removed and re-erected by Mr Henry Stevens of Bishopston. A more important work in which Mr Wills was interested was the endeavour to retain the tower of St Werburgh's Church in Corn Street, after the main portion of the structure was removed to Mina Road. He convened a meeting, at which views of the tower apart from the rest of the structure were shown, the base being pierced to allow of foot passengers going through. The Council at one sitting resolved to preserve the tower, but afterwards reversed its decision, and again rescinded the latter vote, on the antiquaries offering to contribute upwards of Â£1000, the estimated value of the site. Ultimately, however, the negotiations became complicated, and the tower was taken down, much to the regret of Mr Wills, who delighted to point out the effect, when viewed from the upper level, of the many church towers in the centre of the city. In 1867 Mr Wills was president of the Anchor Society, and was appointed a magistrate in 1871.",
22/12/1888,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Thomas Canning,"We had within the last few days to announce the death of a citizen who occupied a prominent position, and we have now to regret the decease of another gentleman, who, for many years took a leading part in local affairs. Yesterday morning Mr Thomas Canning, J.P., died at his residence, Cran Hill, Weston, near Bath. Mr Canning, who was 73 years of age, went to reside near Bath some six or seven years ago, when he left Dorsetshire. He apparently enjoyed good health till a fortnight since. His condition had become so serious on Saturday that the local medical gentlemen, Dr. McDermott and Mr H. W. Freeman (Mayor of Bath), determined to summon Sir Andrew Clark, and that eminent physician arrived on Sunday, but gave no hopes of recovery. Mr Canning was a member of an old Wiltshire family, and for some generations they had been settled near Devizes. He came to Bristol when a young man, and through the introduction of Mr Thomas Fuidge, with whom he was connected by marriage (Mr Canning and Mr Fuidge having married sisters), he became acquainted with Mr James Ford, and he ultimately entered into a partnership which lasted until he left Bristol, about twelve years ago. The business aptitude of Mr Canning, his genial disposition, and courteous manners rendered him well fitted for public life, and in 1852 he was elected a member of Bristol Ward for the Town Council, which position he retained until 1876. In 1863 he was appointed a magistrate for the city, and was mayor for Bristol in 1870-71. During his mayoralty he presented the Corporation, for the collection of pictures at the Mansion House, with a portrait of the late Mr. R .H. Davis MP. Among other undertakings in which he was interested was the Portishead Dock, to which he subscribed Â£2000. In 1872 he was President of the Dolphin Society, and the collection that year amounted to Â£1138, being the largest sum then received in one year for the charity. He became a member of the Board of Charity Trustees in 1865. When he ceased to be connected with Mr Ford in business, he went to reside at Piddletrenthide, near Blandford, Dorset, and was appointed a justice of the peace for the county. He ,however, ceased to reside in Dorsetshire on account of his wife's health, and seven years ago removed to Weston, near Bath. At the time of his death he was besides being a member of the Bristol Charity Trustees, a Governor of Christ's Hospital, London. Mr Canning was a staunch Conservative, and at one time took an active interesting local parliamentary elections. He was a member of the Carlton Club, London, in addition to other similar organisations. He was an enthusiastic sportsman, having been a good shot and capital rider, was well-known with the Badminton hounds, and until a year or so ago he hunted three days a week. When the mastership of the Avon Vale Harriers became vacant recently he was asked to accept the post, but declined on account of increasing years. He took much pleasure in horticulture, and at Westbury-on-Trym successfully reared some magnificent floral specimens, among them very fine azaleas which had scarcely their equal in England. When shown at the Crystal Palace they surpassed all the other collections of plants of the same description. These azaleas were frequently exhibited at the shows held in the Zoological Gardens, Clifton, and when Mr Canning left Westbury-on-Trym, they passed into the possession of Mr W. Proctor Baker, who transferred them to Broomwell House, Brislington. Mr Canning, whose wife survives him, had no children but he leaves several nephews and nieces, some of whom reside in Bristol. The funeral will take place at Locksbrook Cemetery, Weston, on Monday afternoon.",
06/08/1888,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Charles Somerton,"Amongst the obituary notices in another part of the paper will be found one referring to the death of Mr Charles Somerton, of Norman Villa, Canynge Road. Mr Somerton was an old Bristol citizen, and though his quiet, unobtrusive habits prevented him from being so well known as some, his name had been a familiar one for the last generation in Bristol, and a large circle of those who knew him intimately or by reputation will sincerely mourn his decease. He was the son of Mr William H. Somerton, and was born in Bristol. He was educated at Bishop's College, in the neighbourhood of the present Blind Asylum, and afterwards studied at the University College, London, and took his B.A. degree about 1845. His father was proprietor of the Bristol Mercury, and in 1859 his sons Charles and George succeeded him. A little later the Daily Post was published, and, in conjunction with the older paper, was carried on by the two gentlemen till 1883, when both brothers retired from business life. Mr Charles Somerton was a firm Liberal, but declined all requests which would have lead him into a public career. For over a year he has been suffering from an internal ailment, and, at the age of 64, died early yesterday morning. He leaves a widow, but no children. By his kindheartedness and sympathetic nature, Mr Somerton made in private life many warm friendships, and his death will cause deep regret. The funeral will take place at Westbury-on-Trym.",
08/05/1888,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr John W. Dodd,"It is with deep regret we announce the death of Mr John W. Dod, whose name is so familiar to all classes of citizens of account of his munificence to religious and charitable objects, and especially to the fund for the completion of the western towers of the Bristol Cathedral, to which he contributed about Â£7000. The state of Mr Dod's health had of late occasioned great anxiety to his friends. His medical advisor, Mr Hancocke Wathen, and Dr Shingleton Smith, who had seen him in consultation at various times, advised that Mr Lennox Browne, of London, should be asked to see Mr Dod, which he did on Saturday, when he corroborated the grave opinion already formed of Mr Dod's condition. During Saturday night the symptoms became alarming, and on Sunday Mr Dod's condition was so critical that tracheotomy had to be performed. It afforded temporary relief to the patient, but he gradually sank, and death occurred about quarter to twelve o'clock last night.\r\nMr Dod who was 67 years of age, had for many years been connected with the local corn trade, being a partner with Mr. W. K. Wait. He was held in high esteem in commercial circles, and the announcement of his death will be read with sincere regret. Among his many acts of unostentatious liberality was a contribution of Â£1000 to the Royal Infirmary, at a time when the funds of that institution were in great need of assistance, and he also subscribed Â£100 to the fund for erecting a jubilee statue of the Queen.",
08/05/1888,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Rev. Samuel Hebditch,"Information has been received in Bristol of the death, on Saturday morning of the Rev. Samuel Hebditch, who for very many years was closely associated with the progress of Congregationalism in this locality. Mr Hebditch was minister of the church which ultimately built Arley Chapel, and in carrying the erection of that place of worship to completion he was largely instrumental. The late Mr Joseph Foster was also closely identified with the matter. The first sermon in the chapel was preached on the 20th July, 1855, and for about seventeen years after that date Mr Hebditch continued his ministrations there, and by his high personal qualities won the respect of a very large circle of friends. Receiving an invitation to become pastor of Clapton Park Chapel, the rev. gentleman left Alley for the new sphere. After a time the health of his son gave cause for serious anxiety, and Australia being recommended as a suitable climate for the invalid Mr Hebditch obtained leave of absence from his church for a couple of years, and going to the Antipodes, took charge of the Collins Street Congregational Church, an  important chapel in Melbourne. Eventually Mr Hebditch decided to take up his residence permanently in Australia, the health of his son being no doubt being an important consideration influencing his decision. He left this country and became settled as minister of a chapel at North Adelaide, South Australia. He son died subsequently to this, and news was received a week ago that Mr Hebditch himself was seriously ill. On Sunday night came the tidings of his death, having occurred at nine o'clock on the previous morning. Mrs Hebditch and one daughter survive him. At Alley Mr Hebditch was succeeded by the Rev. J. Comper Grey,  whose place was taken by the Rev. S. J. Whitmee, the present minister. Mr Hebditch, though long absent from Bristol, was by no means forgotten, and his death will occasion regret.",
06/04/1888,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Henry Cruger Miles,"We regret to announce the death of Mr Henry Cruger William Miles, which took place yesterday morning at Penpole House. The deceased gentleman had for some months been unwell, and was attended by Mr Ormerod, surgeon, of Westbury-on-Trym. Mr Cruger Miles, like his brother, Mr John William Miles, had never been married, and they both resided with their sister, Miss Clara miles, at Penpole House. The deceased was, we believe, the youngest son of Mr Philip John Miles, whose eldest son was Sir William Miles. On the death of the father, Sir William, who had not been created a baronet, resided at Leigh Court; and Mrs Miles, who was his step-mother, lived at Kingsweston with her children, the sons being Philip Skynner, John William, Robert, Edward, George Frederick, and Henry Cruger. After her decease Mr John William, Mr Henry Cruger, and Miss Miles went to live at Penpole House, Mr Philip Skynner remaining at Kingsweston. Mr Cruger Miles, unobtrusive and retiring in disposition, rarely took an active part in public affairs, but he was High Sheriff of Bristol in 1866, during the mayoralty of Mr William Naish. He was a prominent member of the Society of Merchant Venturers, and took great interest in the schools which were established by the guild. His affability caused him to be surrounded by friends, and beyond this immediate circle his company was much sought after, and he was ready to assist any movement in which his aid was sought. Many years ago, on the occasion of an agricultural show in connection with the Berkeley and Thornbury Society, he was requested to preside at the dinner, and, in allusion to the position, said jocularly that they had in him a strange chairman for an agricultural gathering, as he was not a landowner. He was an ardent horticulturist, and specimens from his gardens and conservatories frequently gained awards at horticultural exhibitions, and this week his gardener carried away many prizes at the Rifle Drill Hall. Field sports found in him a warm supporter, and he was an admirer of horse racing, so that it was no wonder when the Bristol races were started at Knowle he should accept the office of chairman of the company. In that capacity he received his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales when he attended the first meeting, and on the third day of the races he was honoured by the Prince taking tea at the offices of the firm in Queen Square. In his business relations the deceased gentleman paid considerable attention to the operations at the Old Market Street Sugar Refinery, he being a member of the company, and as long as his health permitted he paid frequent visits to the premises. His surviving brothers are Mr Charles Miles, of Malesbury, and Mr George Frederick Miles, who lives near Abergavenny.",
06/04/1888,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Samuel Alexander,"We regret to announce the death of Mr Samuel Alexander, member of the well known firm of Alexander, Daniel, Selfe, and Co., which occurred yesterday morning at his residence, Avondale Lodge, College Road.

Mr Alexander was a Conservative in politics, and though he never took any active part in public matters he was well known and respected in the city, and probably there were few men who possess a keener insight into business matters.

14/03/1888,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr L. A. Goodeve,"We regret to have to announce the death, at a comparatively early age, of Mr L. A. Goodeve, a member of the Western Circuit, and one who has not only occupied important positions connected with the legal profession, but has contributed several valuable works to the law library of the country. Mr Goodeve was the son of Mr Joseph Goodeve, of the Inner Temple and Lincoln's Inn, a well-known Chancery barrister, and a nephew of Dr Goodeve. He was born on January 11th, 1841, and was from 1853 to 1859 at school at Westminster, being captain of the school in the latter part of the period. Then he became Junior Student at Christ Church, Oxford. In 1862 he took the B.A. degree, and in June, 1865, was called to the Bar by the Middle Temple; he joined the Home Circuit, but in November of the same year was admitted Advocate of the High Court of Calcutta. While in practice their he edited the Government law reports from 1868 to 1873; was Professor of Law and Jurisprudence at the Presidency College, Calcutta. in 1871, and Clerk of the Crown for the September Criminal Sessions in 1872. In addition to the duties of these positions, he from 1871 to 1873 was examiner for law degrees at Calcutta University, and in the two latter years examiner of pleaders, &c., for the Government of Bengal, in both the legislative and judicial departments. In December 1873 he left India, and, determining to devote his attention to English practice, joined the Western Circuit in 1874. His opinion on legal matters was highly valued, and his services were frequently retained in cases which presented difficult legal points. During 1878 and the two following years Mr Goodeve was lecturer on law at the Bristol University College, and on several occasions since his residence in Bristol he has acted as the deputy for the judge in the Bristol and district county courts.  In addition to the editorial work in connection with the Government law reports already alluded to, he edited the Indian Jurist at Calcutta from 1866 to 1868. His energy even in such a climate as that of Calcutta was not exhausted by the onerous positions he there filled, for in 1871 he published a new edition of 'The Law of Evidence as administered in England and applied to India,' and the next year issued a supplement to the 'Law of Evidence -India Evidence Act, 1872.' After his association with the Western Circuit he continued writing, and has given to the world several books evincing much research and legal knowledge. In 1877 he published 'Railway Passengers and Railway Companies: their Rights, duties, and Liabilities,' to which in 1880 he added an appendix with appenda to date. A second edition of this work was called for in 1885. 'The Modern Law of Real Property,' which he published in 1883, was made the text book at Oxford and Cambridge and in bar examinations. Not long after the passing of Mr Chamberlain's bill in 1883 Mr Goodeve wrote, 'An exposition of the new law of bankruptcy,' and only last year became the author of a treatise on the modern law of real property. For the last month he has been seriously ill, and has been attended by Drs Greig Smith and Shingleton Smith, with Drs Lawson Tait and Boyes Smith of Netley, in consultation. He, however, gradually became weaker, and died at half-past five yesterday afternoon. Outside of the legal profession the deceased gentleman had a large circle of friends, and deep sympathy will be widely felt with Mrs Goodeve and the five children who survive him.",

06/06/1888,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Sir Philip Miles,"We regret to announce the death of Sir Philip John William Miles, of Leigh Court, who expired last night at his London residence, after a few hours' illness, in his 63rd year. The deceased baronet was the son of Sir William Miles, of Leigh Court, and was born September 2nd 1825. He was educated at Eton, and subsequently at Trinity College, Cambridge. He afterwards became lieutenant in the 17th Lancers. As a magistrate for Somerset he sat on the Long Ashton bench; he was also a deputy lieutenant for the county. The family of Miles had been for a long time closely connected with the affairs of Bristol, and several members served the office of High Sheriff, the deceased baronet in 1853, when Sir John George Shaw was Mayor, his uncle Mr Cruger Miles in 1864, and his brother Mr William Henry Miles in 1866. In 1879  Sir Philip was President of the Dolphin Society, his brother Mr W.H.Miles having been president in 1874. When vacancies were caused in the parliamentary representation of East Somerset, Sir Philip and Lord Brooke were elected, and the former held his seat until 1885 , when he did not seek re-election. As a member Sir Philip won much popularity among his constituents. Like others of his family, he was a staunch Conservative, and he took  much interest in agricultural matters, frequently attending meetings and dinners in different parts of the division. In 1848 he married Frances Elizabeth, daughter of Sir David Roche. Their children who survive are Alice Catherine, who married in 1870, Mr George Duppa; Edith Clare who married in 1875, Mr C. W. Mansel Lewis; and Mabel Constance, who married, in 1884, Mr C. Gausseu. Sir Philip's seat, Leigh Court, is one of the most charming mansions in the neighbourhood, of Bristol, and occasionally the house and grounds have been thrown open on the occasion of entertainments given for charitable objects. In December, 1881, Lady Miles organised a concert in aid of the East End Hospital for Children, and the great hall was crowded. Sir Philip moved about among the company, setting all at their ease, and seemed as delighted at the pleasure experienced by the company as they were in inspecting the art treasures and listening to the well selected programme, taken part in by well-distinguished amateurs and professionals. A more important occasion which brought Leigh Court prominently before the public was the visit of the Prince of Wales, who arrived on the 28th January, 1884. In accordance with the desire of His Royal Highness, there was no public reception, but in the evening of the following day, the Prince attended a concert at Colston Hall given by Sir Philip and Lady Miles in aid of the funds of Bristol Infirmary and the General Hospital. Though the attendance was not so large as had been anticipated, Â£110 was handed over to the charities, and Lady Miles was enabled to redeem a promise which she had made three years before to get up  a performance in aid of the local medical institutions. Sir Philip entertained the Prince on the days of his visit by providing some shooting parties, and the royal guest departed from Leigh Court on the 31st January. Sir Philip and Lady Miles spent a great deal of time in London, their town house being 75, Cornwall Gardens. Death has of late been busy with the members of the Miles family, as not many months  ago Sir Philip's younger brother, Mr William Henry Miles, of Ham Green, died after a short illness, and more recently his uncle, Mr Cruger Miles, expired at Penpole House. Sir Philip was the second baronet, his father Mr William Miles, having had a baronetcy conferred upon him in 1859 for his public services, especially as chairman of Somerset Quarter Sessions. He was the chief partner in the large private banking company, which carried on its operations in Corn Street. Sir Philip took no part in the affairs of the bank, though the younger brother, Mr William Henry, was an active partner. He was patron of the living of Walton with Weston-in-Gordano.",

He represented the Western Division of Gloucestershire, in the Liberal interest, from 1832 to 1847. In 1836 he published his novel 'Berkeley Castle,' and feeling much annoyed at the severe strictures passed upon it in Fraser's Magazine, committed a violent assault upon the publisher. For this an action was brought by Mr Fraser, who obtained a verdict with Â£100 damages. Dr Maginn, who declared himself the author of the article which had given offence, was challenged by Mr Berkeley, and was slightly wounded by him in the duel that ensued. Mr Berkeley who has been a master of stag and fox hounds, is well known as a proficient in all kinds of field sports, and is the author of 'Laudon Hall;''Reminiscences of a Huntsman;''A Month in the Forests of France;'The English Sportsman in the Western Prairies;' 'My Life and Recollections,' 1864; and 'Tales of Life and Death,' two vols, 1869.

03/08/1881,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Captain H. Edgar,"A figure long familiar to Cliftonians, and a cheery, soldierly face which leaves many a friend behind to regret its loss, will be missed by the death of Captain H. Edgar, for 25 years an officer of the 26th Cameronians who died on Monday night at Clifton. Captain Edgar's health failed many years ago, and obliged him to retire from the service, which he left a quarter of a century since, and soon after settled down as a Bristolian. He had served in India and China during war, with gallantry and credit, and to the end of his days remained a soldier at heart, noting every change in the army with keen interest, though often noting it with doubt and misgiving as to the result. An attached admirer of the regimental system,as founded by Moore, a fellow soldier of Clyde and Gough, Captain Edgar accepted their views on military matters. But with a proper sense of discipline he always held it was the duty of those who were left in the army to obey the spirit of the times, and carry on with fidelity each change that was decided on. Socially Captain Edgar was a bright and happy companion, whose long life and tenacious memory enabled him to tell many a story with the effect that an active share in the events always confers. But the gallant old gentleman was far more ready to note what others had performed than to speak of himself. Of late years his health seemed to improve and he went out in society, but for a twelvemonth or more he accepted no invitations and saw little beyond a few old friends who regularly 'looked him up'. A change for the worse being feared by Mr Pritchard, his usual medical attendant, Dr. Fox was brought in for consultation three weeks ago, and considered that the heart disease from which his patient suffered had made dangerous progress. Still when a friend called on him Sunday evening Captain Edgar was hopeful of a favourable turn, and it was not till late on Monday that the fatal attack commenced. For several hours his sufferings were great, and Captain Edgar died about eleven o'clock.",
12/12/1881,Western Daily Press,Obituary,"General Purcell, R.A.","It is with much regret we have to record the death of this officer, which occurred at his house in Pembroke Road, Clifton, on Friday last. General Purcell had been a sufferer for many months from cancer in the throat, for the alleviation of which operations and other remedies had been unavailingly tried. He lately commanded the Auxiliary Artillery in this district, and in the exercise of his duties made many friends. The urbanity and tact required in adjusting the frequent differences arising with imperfectly disciplined troops were qualities which General Purcell  understood and possessed to an in an eminent degree, and in society he was deservedly popular. General Purcell's war services were chiefly performed in the West Indies. In 1859 he served under Col.

17/01/1888,Bristol Times and Mirror,Obituary,Col. David Macliver,"It is with feelings of very sincere regret that we receive intelligence of the death of Colonel David Macliver, the only son of Mr P. S. Macliver, of the Western Daily Press, in which business the lamented deceased was co-partner with his father.\r\nUpon the establishment of the Daily Press - some quarter of a century ago- Mr David Macliver came with his father from Newcastle to Bristol; and in addition to his occupation at the office, he devoted a considerable portion of his time to military duties, joining the Somerset militia at Bath, under the colonelcy of Col. Pinney, in which regiment he soon obtained a captaincy, and subsequently became Major. He took a great interest in military work, and passed an excellent examination at the School of Musketry at Hythe, becoming, in his turn, musketry instructor to his corps. Upon his retirement from the militia, about 13 years ago, Major Macliver joined the First Gloucestershire Engineer Volunteers, taking on his rank as major. He afterwards succeeded to the command of the corps, on the retirement of Lieut-Col. Washbourne, and held that position until within a fortnight of his death, when he was gazetted out and received the honorary rank of Lieut.-Colonel, in succession to the Duke of Beaufort, who with characteristic kindness and thoughtfulness, voluntarily offered to retire from that position in order that Colonel Macliver, on resigning his command, should not lose his rank and title. Colonel Macliver also manifested much interest in the establishment of the Submarine Mining Corps, of which he was hon. commandant. Ill-health also compelled Col. Macliver to retire at the end of last year from all business, including his magisterial duties, he having been added to the commission of the peace for the city of Bristol some six years ago. The deceased gentleman took an active part in local affairs, and frequently in church matters. He was Churchwarden of Christchurch, Broad Street, during the progress of its restoration, to which he liberally contributed. He served also on the Bristol Church Extension Commission; was for some time one of the honorary secretaries of the Bristol Bishopric Fund, his resignation having only been recently announced by Archdeacon Norris on account of failing health; and he was a member for the commission for inquiring into the condition of the Bristol poor. In politics Colonel Macliver was an Advanced Liberal, though he never obtruded his views into private life. He was selected by the Liberal Association of Chippenham, as their candidate a few years ago; but the redistribution scheme by which the Wiltshire borough was disenfranchised, added to pronounced ill-health, led him to abandon political life. He remained however, a member of the the Reform Club, and in 1884 he was president of the Anchor Society, when his collection amounted to Â£1002 - one of the largest recorded in the history of the society. On one occasion, too, he was president of the Caledonian Society. It was naturally the wish of the family to have brought the body home for interment; but the medical authorities at Cannes, where he died, ordered immediate burial, and we learn that the funeral will accordingly take place to-day. Colonel Macliver had gone to the South of France, with Mrs Macliver, in the hope that a residence in a warmer climate would effect a change for the better; but the malady from which he was suffering - disease of the heart -  gave his friends great anxiety, and but slight hope of his complete recovery.Colonel Macliver was a kind-hearted gentleman, whose genial temperament and unobtrusive demeanour rendered him a very pleasant companion; and by those who knew him well he was highly esteemed as a friend. Amongst his brethren of the press he was deservedly respected; and, speaking for ourselves personally, we can truly say that our connection with him in business matters was one  which we can only remember as having ever been marked by pleasant associations. The flags on the civic buildings were half-masted yesterday as a token of respect for the deceased gentleman. Colonel Macliver who was 45 years old, leaves a widow - a daughter of Major Brooks, of Tetbury - and an only son, a child twelve years old.",

08/09/1919,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Rev. J. Moffat Logan,"We regret to announce the death of the Rev. J. Moffat Logan, after many years of eminently successful ministerial work in Bristol and at Accrington. For a considerable time his health had been unsatisfactory, and in February last he broke down altogether owing to haemorrhage of the throat, with complications. He passed away on Saturday, and his death was announced last night to the congregation at Old King Street Baptist Chapel, Bristol.\r\nMr Moffat Logan came to Bristol at the beginning of 1831, as minister of Old King Street Baptist Chapel. This historic church had then been for some time without a pastor, the services were thinly attended, and the financial position left much to be desired. It was therefore in circumstances requiring a good deal of courage that Mr Logan accepted the invitation sent to him in the autumn of 1890. He was then minister at Bromley, Kent, previous to which to was at Egremont. He had been trained for his ministerial work at Rawdon College. His advent at Old King Street was marked by conditions calculated to try the spirit of a faint-hearted minister, but happily Mr Logan was not a man easily daunted. The morning of January 4th, his first Sunday with his new people, was cold and misty and in a church that will seat a thousand persons, the small congregation looked the smaller. The officers of the church had issued a circular to the members and worshippers stating that they had every hope and confidence that with Devine blessing, Mr Logan's ministry would be successful, and that he would be the means of restoring spiritual tone and strength to the church, and infusing new life and vigour into its various organizations. They did not conceal from themselves that that could only be done with the prayerful and zealous co-operation of the members with their pastor, and they appealed to each one to do his or her part towards affecting the desired revival. It may be interesting to add that Mr Logan's first sermon, preached under these conditions, was based on the words 'Be strong and of good courage; be not afraid, neither be dismayed.' The recognition service was held a couple of months later, on March 11th, under the presidency of Mr Charles Townsend, and sanguine hopes that a new era of prosperity had dawned for Old King Street Chapel were expressed by the speakers who joined in the proceedings. Happily these auguries were justified by the subsequent history of the church.\r\nMr Logan's achievement was followed by a rapid increase in the congregation, and he soon came to be known throughout this district as a man of considerable originality and as a speaker who was particularly able in controversy. He had had considerable experience in debate, and displayed and again in argumentative duels, a wonderful alertness in appreciating an opponent's contention and seeing a weak point in it, and with this quality he combined much ability in forcibly presenting his own views. A public debate with a well-known secularist, Mr G. W. Foote, excited a great deal of interest at the time. Although one of the strongest advocates of peace and locally a leader of the conciliation movement brought into existence by the South African war, Mr Logan was essentially a fighter in the sense indicated, and again and again on the platform and in newspaper columns he found himself engaged in argumentative combat. These qualities of the mind soon after his arrival in Bristol found expression the men's Sunday afternoon discussion class at Old King Street, at which a variety of social and religious subjects were discussed wit much spirit. Current topics, predominantly occupying the public attention for the moment, were again and again selected as the themes for consideration at these gatherings, at which all were welcomed. Mr Logan apparently had not the fear which would have influenced differently constituted minds that topics on which opinion was acutely divided might in heated debate lead to displays of feeling not easy to control. Some of his addresses delivered on special occasions, and after careful preparation, were really fine pieces of work, bristling with points most effectively put, and notably free from platitudes.\r\nAt one time Mr Logan was known as a lecturer on characters famous in history, but in later years he preferred to devote his energies more to matters closely associated with ministerial and social work. During the pastorate of Mr Logan at Old King Street the membership rose from 131 to 620; church agencies showed a marked increase in vitality, and an important scheme of church renovation and improvement was carried out. In a variety of ways, therefore, the confidence with which the committee of the church looked forward to Mr Logan's work was justified, probably even more amply than sanguine members anticipated would have been possible.\r\nIn 1902 the Rev. Moffat Logan accepted an invitation to become minister of Cannon Street Baptist Chapel, Accrington, where for 17 years he laboured with marked success. An Accrington correspondent writes:- He was a sweet and compelling personality, and he won widespread affections. Never physically robust he confined his energies to the enunciation and furtherance of Baptist tenets. He had the intense fervour that come with his Scottish ancestry, and though a believer in the harmonious association of Free Churches, he beheld clearly their distinctions. From that trait in his character proceeded many of his actions. He was firmly opposed to payment in the education rate for religious instruction over which Nonconformity had no control, and as a passive resister made an annual speech of protest at the police court until last year. He took the keenist delight in philosophic and sectarian subtleties. Special sermons he delivered at the Cannon Street Church - a feature he observed throughout his ministry - were, in their exposition of Nonconformity, interpreted as a challenge to Catholicism, and he was challenged by the Rev. Father Lester, of the Church of the Sacred Heart, an influential Catholic Church in Accrington, to debate the principles he condemned. A long newspaper controversy ensued into the doctrines of transubstantiation, and other essential differences between the churches, and was followed for months by the keenest interest by ardent religionists. Christian Science he condemned. His opposition to such play as Stanley' Houghton's 'Younger Generation,' produced by an Accrington dramatic society at a local theatre, was typical of his attitude towards certain tendencies he deplored. Yet, if rigid in some respects, he was astonishingly broad in other ways. In his early days in Accrington he astonished an audience at a Gospel Temperance Mission meeting by stating that if a man after a walk to Whalley (a countryside village) would not enjoy dropping in at 'William John's' (the licensee of a public house) and having a bottle of Bass he would not believe him. Mr Logan was for a period moderator of the Lancashire and Cheshire Association of Baptist Churches.",

S. Fry and Sons, and for some years took an active part in the public life of the city.\r\nMr Francis James Fry, himself cultured and with strong literary and scientific tendencies, was connected with a family all of whom manifested individuality and great ability in different directions. His father, Mr Francis Fry, F.S.A., who died in 1885, at his residence, Tower House, Cotham, was long known among the biographers of the country as an ardent student of Biblical literature, and his name is remembered on account of the old editions of the Scriptures which he edited and reissued. A prominent politician was the deceased's brother, Sir Theodore Fry, long M.P. for Darlington. Cousins of Mr Francis James Fry were Sir Edward Fry, Mr Joseph Storrs Fry, the Right Hon. Lewis Fry, and Albert Fry. The deceased was born in our city on 18th March, 1835. He was educated at Mr Exley's school, a famous academy in Cotham Road that stood upon the site of the present Congregational College. Many men who became prominent in different walks of life owed their early education to the instruction at Exley's. After he left school Mr Francis James Fry entered the firm of Messrs J. S. Fry and Sons, in Union Street, that celebrated establishment being then very much smaller than the existing factory. For many years he was partner in the firm of which his father and two uncles, Joseph and Richard, had been proprietors. Mr Francis Fry was for a time the only survivor of the three manufacturers. Afterwards the sons of Mr Francis Fry and Mr Joseph Fry, assisted by several of the junior members of the family, managed the affairs of the firm. During the time that Mr Francis James Fry was a partner the premises were at different times considerably enlarged. The splendid factory at the bottom of the Pithay, and extending into Nelson Street, covering an enormous area of ground, was built in 1878, and subsequently other spacious structures in Quay Street, Christmas Street, and St. John's Street, came to be built while Mr Francis James Fry and his cousin, Mr Joseph Storrs Fry remained heads of the great firm which had developed quite a cocoa colony in the centre of the city. When the business became converted into a limited liability company the deceased was a director.\r\nWhile studying the interests of the company, Mr F. J. Fry was by no means unmindful of other affairs. He was a director of the Bristol Wagon and Carriage Works Company Ltd., which position he retained until a few years ago. In 1886-87 he was Sheriff of the city and county of Bristol, and in 1906 Sheriff of the county of Somerset, and in 1893 was elected alderman, a position he retained for some years. He became justice of the peace for Bristol in 1877, and when he ceased to reside in the city and went to live near Chard he was created a Justice of the Peace for the county of Somerset, and subsequently a Deputy-Lieutenant. Among the appointments which the deceased held were the following:- President of the Fine Arts Academy, a member of the University Council, and a member of the Board of Municipal Charity Trustees, all local; and he was besides a Fellow of the Physical Society of London. He was also President of the Bristol Footpath Preservation Society, and, in that capacity, very closely concerned in several successful proceedings for the protection of public rights. Especially may be mentioned the lengthly proceedings with respect to St. Anne's  Ferry, and also the actions in respect of public rights of recreation and common over Walton Common, near Clevedon, right of common over Filton Common, and more recently in the case of rights of way at Alfoxden, near Kilve and Holford, tried in 1915 at Bristol Assize before Lord Coleridge. Mr Fry brought to the consideration of these cases and the evidence in support of the public rights concerned, an extremely calm and well balanced judgement, and this contributed in no small measure to the success which in each case resulted from the support given by the society of which he was President.\r\nScientific pursuits presented great charm for him, and upon the occasion of a visit of the learned societies to Bristol or places in the neighbourhood - as when the British Association met in Bath and subsequently in our city - he might be seen with his valuable microscope showing and explaining objects to visitors at their soirees.",

Under her guidance the school developed in all directions - in numbers, in extension of the buildings, and also in the standard and breadth of the education provided. The 'Charles Ryland' Library, opened in 1912, is the glory of the school, and betrays on all sides evidence of the care and thought which she bestowed upon every detail of its building and equipment. Her work for the school, however, cannot be estimated by its material and numerical growth only, for she had a higher purpose than this in view, and she always considered that the success of the school depended upon its influence on the characters and ideals of the girls. It was a great source of thankfulness to know that many of her pupils as they passed through the school, did develop a strong sense of responsibility and a willingness to serve which would make them worthy citizens of a great Empire. A personality such as that of Mrs Gatliff, so full of keen enthusiasm and energy, so sympathetic in joy and sorrow, will ever live, in the school which owes so much to her untiring devotion and care, and also in the hearts and minds of many generations of Colston mistresses and girls, for to work with her and under her was an inspiration, and governors, parents, staff, and girls all knew that in her they had a true friend, every ready with wise council and kindly sympathy.",

14/12/1918,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr William Redwood,"Well-Known Bristol Journalist\r\n\r\nThe Lord Mayor's Tribute\r\n\r\nIt is with sincere regret that we announce the unexpected death of Mr William Redwood, for many years chief reporter of the 'Western Daily Press'. He passed away at his residence 55, Arley Hill, yesterday, after a brief illness.\r\nMr William Redwood was born at Sampford Peverell, Devon, on the 10th August 1851, and was therefore 67 years of age. He received his journalistic training on the 'Tiverton and North Devon Gazette'. In 1876 he joined the reporting staff of the 'Western Daily Press' of which he became Chief Reporter in 1890. In that capacity he had more to do with the promotion of public policy and social welfare in Bristol than most people are aware of. He was never a partisan in any sense of the word, and his pen was at the willing service of any good cause. It is scarcely too much to say that he was the best known journalist in the city. His record of attendance at meetings of the City Council, for instance, went further back than that of even the senior aldermen, and in other branches of public work he had many interesting stories to tell, as well as useful information to impart to those who were succeeding to prominent positions. He enjoyed the complete confidence of the members of the firm Messrs Walter Reid and Son, and since the demise of the partners he had been one of the directors. His relations with the public, as well as with the staff, were always marked by the utmost fairness.\r\nIt was a fortunate circumstance for the West of England Press Fund that soon after Mr Redwood came to Bristol he was induced to undertake the honorary secretaryship, for it has been largely through his efforts that the Fund has been built up on a substantial basis, whilst kindred organisations in other parts of the country have merged into the London Press Fund. Mr Redwood had also filled the offices of President, and was lately, on relinquishing the hon. secretaryship, appointed Senior Vice-President. He was one of the first to join the Bristol branch of the Institute of Journalists, of which he became President and Fellow, and he was a member of the Orphan Fund Committee. He was a member of the London Press Fund. For the greater part of his life he was an enthusiastic member of the Manchester Unity of Oddfellows, and, besides filling various offices in the Bristol District, he acted in an executive capacity, and was a trustee. Before the State took in hand the work of granting old-age pensions, he devoted considerable attention to the subject and wrote a pamphlet, and a copy of this was brought to the notice of Mr Joseph Chamberlain, who at the time was showing marked interest in the subject. Mr Redwood was also a founder of the Society of Devonians in Bristol, of which he was Past President. In Masonic circles too, Mr Redwood did useful work, and was highly esteemed. He was secretary and Past Master of St Augustine's Lodge, of which he was one of the founders, and was associated also with the Beaufort Lodge. He held office in the Provincial Grand Lodge, and in respect of his musical abilities with the cornet, he was P.P.G.O. He was also a member of the Beaufort Chapter of Royal Arch Masters, as well as of the Baldwyn and Dunckerley Lodge of Mark Masons. Having been installed into the chair of the latter, he recently had the delightful experience of receiving from his brethren a substantial contribution to the Press Fund Jubilee appeal. He was a member of the Commercial Rooms and of the Liberal Club.\r\nMr Redwood was a member of the British journalists who visited Canada in 1907 on the invitation of the Dominion Government, and his contributions to the paper were subsequently published in book form with the title of 'Canada as I Saw It'.",
19/02/1917,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Walter Reid,"We deeply regret to announce the death of Mr Walter Reid, which occurred last evening at his residence, The Woodlands, Woodland Road, Tyndall Park. For one who was in his eighty-ninth year Mr Reid enjoyed good health until about ten days ago when he contracted a severe cold, which confined him to the house. It was not, however, until Thursday night that the illness took a serious turn, and the end of a long and honourable career came with surprising quickness.\r\nMr Reid was a North countryman. His father, Mr John Reid, belonged to South Shields, but his son, Walter was born at Darlington and there he spent his boyhood. Darlington was the first provincial town to make the bold experiment of publishing a daily newspaper, and it also became memorable in the early chapters of railway history. The modern passenger system which plays so great a part in the world may be said to date from the Stockton and Darlington line, opened in 1825, and although this occurred before the advent of Mr Reid, this epoch-making railway made a strong impression upon one who throughout life showed the strongest interest in everything connected with engineering and mechanical development. The line, which had one of its termini in his native town, was the first of the kind in the world; it was several years ahead of its continental successor, and to the end of his long career Mr Reid loved to talk of the early railway days, when every step was in the nature of an experiment, and when even those who had visions of the future scarcely dared picture what the railway enterprise has become. Newspaper life in a Newcastle office claimed Mr Reid's attention, and while a journalistic career might seem to lead away from the natural bent, it was not really so for the story of newspaper work during the past half century has been inseparably linked with new applications of science and wonderful illustrations of mechanical ingenuity. For Newcastle, which thus became the scene of his early work in a newspaper office, Mr Reid always cherished a fondness. Even in his later life, after his interests had been identified with Bristol for 40 or 50 years, he followed the development of the Northern town, read its newspapers, and in conversation frequently quoted it where he thought its enterprise ought to be an inspiration to Bristolians. Mr Reid, while at Newcastle, married Miss Nichol, and he was still resident in his northern home when his work came under the notice of Mr P. Stewart Macliver, who engaged him to come South to provide Bristol with its first daily newspaper.\r\nThis momentous step was taken in 1858, and in the 20th century, when daily journals and, indeed, journals which issue many editions in the course of a day, are so familiar as to have become matters of course, it is difficult to realise the courage involved in the enterprise in which these two men were engaged. Writing of a period slightly antecedent to this Mr Alexander Paterson has given an interesting word picture of the conditions: 'In the larger towns, the principal papers had begun to be published twice, and in some cases thrice a week, but so far there was still no provincial daily press. Some of the London weekly papers had good sales, more particularly in the towns, but it was only in the newsroom that one was able to catch a glimpse of the daily. The local journals were the only ones ever seen in the houses of the 'middle and labouring classes' and these were for the most part circulated through the medium of clubs ... Today, yesterday's or last week's paper is a thing of no value; fifty years ago tattered and dirty sheets a fortnight or three weeks' old were diligently read from title page to imprint, and sometimes even carefully folded and put aside for future perusal.' (These words were written about 16 years ago). And when the provincial daily began to make its appearance, the older school of journalists met the new arrival in a spirit of bemused contempt. The difficulties of daily production were immense. Neither the organisation of the news services nor the telegraphic facilities were comparable with what they have since become, and journalistic progress had been hindered by a fiscal system which taxed paper, the advertisements, and the newspapers themselves. A writer who constituted the entire 'reporting staff' of one of the earliest of penny dailies says: 'Their proprietors were laughed at for their trouble by the multitude, while those who did profess to encourage the enterprise paid their penny with a sort of patronising air, and under the impression that the current number would be the last of the venture'.The weekly papers would not bestow a word upon the project: the idea was too contemptible for even a thought from them'. Another writer has added that 'the reporters of the weeklies in those days would hardly recognise the daily men as their professional brethren, and when drawn into conversation in which any of the new venture was mentioned would either profess to be ignorant of its existence, or contemptuously speak of it as 'that rag''.\r\nAbout half a dozen daily papers had been started, in spite of this adverse environment, but there was not one published between London and Penzance. In this vast untouched area Mr Macliver and Mr Walter Reid came to try the experiment of a daily paper for Bristol and the West of England. For the practical work of that undertaking the greater responsibility fell on Mr Reid. He was not only Editor, but it was to him that others looked when, in arrangement for printing the new sheet, difficulties had to be promptly solved. It is a matter of common knowledge that success followed his efforts, the predictions of critics were falsified, the public became used to a daily paper and demanded it. Mr Reid from the first appeared as an advocate of a policy of civic progress: his early articles indicated a feeling that Bristol had larger responsibilities before it than it had realised, and that the comparative neglect of the port was a subject upon which this young north countryman wrote clearly and strongly. His advocacy therefore became a help to those who desired to see the adoption of a forward policy, and in regard to political matters, his policy of dealing with opponents with impartiality evoked a large body of public approval. The correspondence columns of his paper were open to all schools of thought; all parties found their proceedings fairly reported by members of his staff, and he held firmly to the opinion that ones' own case could be stated without discourtesy to those who took another view.\r\nThus the first daily of Bristol had the foundations of success. It not only stimulated the interest in national themes, but also quickened a healthy interchange of views, and this tended to the formation of an enlightened public opinion. While many things have changed with the lapse of half a century, some have not. The determination in journalistic work to show absolute impartiality in reports, and fairness in comment, is as potent as ever it was; the temptations of a 'new journalism' have been powerless to vary the principles laid down in 1858, and , in the larger responsibilities of the modern city, the advocacy of well considered progress, and an inculcation of a vigorous belief in Bristol's possibilities are still held to be the duty of those responsible for a daily newspaper. Even in the personal there has been an unusual measure of continuity.\r\nThe Bristol 'Observer' was started in February 1859, and Bristol's first evening paper, the 'Evening News', in 1877. Having outgrown the offices in Broad Street (now absorbed into the block of municipal buildings), new premises were built in Baldwin Street, and occupied in 1885. Mr Macliver's son, Colonel Davis Macliver, died in 1888; and upon the decease of Mr P. S. Macliver, in 1891, Mr Walter Reid became the sole proprietor of these three journals. Subsequently he took his son, Mr W. Nichol Reid, into partnership. Although leaving much responsibility to others, Mr Walter Reid continued his personal oversight to the end of his exceptionally long journalistic career. He had contributed miscellaneous articles to magazines, and in earlier days published a volume of stories; he was a Fellow of the Institute of Journalists, and at one time served as the President of the Bristol District; a member of the National Liberal Club, the Bristol Liberal Club, and the Bristol Commercial Rooms, but his devotion to and sense of responsibility for the conduct of the papers  under his charge was so keen that he devoted his energies almost solely to this work.\r\nThe celebration of the jubilee of the 'Western Daily Press' possessed a greater interest, because the man responsible for the practical work of initiation still remained at the helm. In February 1908, when the annual dinner of the 'Western Daily Press' 'Chapel' took place, the coming jubilee and Mr Reid's work were the subject of many congratulatory references.\r\nFor years Mr Reid was one of the Governors of the Bristol Royal Infirmary, and held a similar position at the Queen Victoria Memorial Convalescent Home. In the welfare of each of these institutions, he took a keen interest. It may not be generally known that it was his suggestion that led to the formation of the University College Colston Society, an organisation that perhaps more than any other helped secure the realisation of a university for Bristol. It occurred to Mr Reid, as he noted the recurring celebrations on November 13, that while the philanthropic side of Edward Colston's activities had received the fullest attention, the educational phases of his work had not been adequately kept in memory. He put this before the late Mr J. W. Arrowsmith, who was keenly interested in the University scheme, and suggested a new Colston Society which would supplement the scope of older societies and strengthen the bands of those who were advocating educational development, especially by the creation of a University with its headquarters in this city. The fear of unduly arousing existing societies made Mr Arrowsmith hesitate about accepting the proposal, but  Mr Reid pressed his point, and the University Colston Society was formed. It was already a record of which any institution might be proud. At its annual dinners many notable addresses had been given, and it is beyond doubt that these anniversaries have exercised a potent influence in Bristol and the district, and contributed in no small degree to the promotion of that spirit which has led to princely gifts  for the foundation and development of the University. It is naturally a source of pleasure to Mr Reid to realise the happy result that followed his proposal to Mr Arrowsmith, and when in a reminiscent mood he realised also the assistance he was able to give through the 'Western daily Press' at a much earlier period - the period at which the troublesome problem of the reorganisation of old endowed schools of Bristol had to be faced. \r\nAdvocates of dock extension found him to be a warm supporter in days when Bristol opinion was divided and it seemed as if a bold step forward would never be taken under municipal auspices. He favoured the dockisation of the river for a long period, but realising the hindrance to it being sanctioned by Parliament was delaying progress, he supported the provision of ocean docks at Avonmouth. In these and many other matters he followed with sympathy Bristol movements, and although he rarely appeared on a public platform, by his newspapers he was able to help in the formation of public opinion and thus bring about the desired result.\r\nMr Reid lost his wife between thirty and forty years ago, and in more recent times suffered a series of bereavements, the last of these being the death of his only son, Mr W. Nichol Reid, in July, 1915. While feeling the effect of these successive blows, he bore up with wonderful resolution, and showed unabated interest in business matters, philanthropic work, and the questions of the day. Shortly after his son's death a private company was formed to take over the three newspapers, Mr Walter Reid being its chairman. The directorate was composed of experienced members of the staff, together with Mr Walter Reid Warton, Mr Reid's grandson. Mr Reid's death removes one who for nearly fifty-nine years has closely and sympathetically followed the city's fortunes, who looked with satisfaction at the forward strides made since he became one of its citizens, and who showed confidence that has a great future before it.",

Lewis Fry was the fourth son of Mr Joseph Fry, who was at that time senior partner in the firm of J. S. Fry and Sons, Union Street. Educated at home and at Mr John Exley's School at Cotham, Lewis, like his distinguished brother, the Right Hon. Sir Edward Fry, turned to the law as a profession, entering the office of Messrs Livett, solicitors, as an articled  pupil also going to Chambers in London to study. In 1854 he was admitted as a solicitor and commenced practice in Bristol with the late Mr W. Tanner in Shannon Court and later he became senior partner of the well-known firm of Messrs Fry, Abbot, Pope and Brown. His professional career well fitted Mr Fry for the place he was destined to fill in later life in municipal and State affairs. Whilst still practising as a solicitor he began to take an interest in public life and so multifarious became his duties that he soon ceased to take an active part in the business of his firm so that he could throw himself whole heartedly into civic affairs. For eighteen years Mr Fry did splendid work for the city  as a member of the Bristol Council, to which he was first elected as a representative for Clifton in 1866. In 1872 he was elected for St. Philip and Jacob in conjunction with Mr Mark Whitwill and Mr C. J. Thomas, and continued to represent that ward until 1880 when a re-arrangement of the wards of the city took place. He  was then returned for St. Philip's South and remained in the Council for another four years when much to the regret of the citizens he found it necessary to retire owing to the pressure of his Parliamentary duties, he having occupied a seat in the House  of Commons since 1878.\r\n\r\nPioneer of Education\r\n\r\n Mr Fry was always keenly interested in education, and it was therefore fitting in 1871, when the School Board was formed in Bristol, that he should be one of its first members and that his fellow members, recognising his high qualifications, should elect him to the position of chairman of the board. Mr Fry's reply to this confidence and commitment was: 'It will be my earnest endeavour  to assist in carrying the Act into effect  in a wise and liberal spirit  without regard to sect or party.' In those days there were only 18,628 children in the public schools of Bristol.\r\nAt the instance of Mr Fry, the Bishop of Hereford (then Canon Percival), and other members, the Board laid down the lines on the question of religious teaching which were subsequently adopted by nearly all the School Boards in England. Mr Fry's tact, wide knowledge, and moderation in the interpretation of the clauses of the Act proved invaluable to the Board, and the members harmonized in the work with the best results. Mr Fry  was chairman of the first three Boards - a period of nine years. Then, owing to the demands of his Parliamentary duties, he retired. In a speech that was made to the vote of thanks to Mr Fry, it was stated that he had been the most perfect and best chairman any school Board could possibly find, and that the Board and the citizens would experience a great loss. Apart from his work in the School Board, Mr Fry showed a keen interest in education in other directions. He was one of the original founders of Bristol University College, becoming on the death of his brother Mr Albert Fry, chairman of that body. With many other prominent citizens Mr Fry recognized the great value a university would be to a commercial city like Bristol, and displayed much enthusiasm in promoting the scheme which resulted in the establishment of the present University, the charter for which was granted in 1909. Mr Fry, who had subscribed generously to the funds, was elected to the chairmanship of the Council and became a Pro- Chancellor, in both of which capacities he  rendered valued services and materially promoted the welfare of the University College. Mr Fry was president of the College Colston Society in 1905, and he was supported at the annual dinner by such distinguished guests as the then Master of Trinity  College, Cambridge, and Sir Oliver Lodge. \r\nMr Fry took part in the successful efforts which placed the Museum and Library Institution on an improved basis when it was removed to the top of Park Street, and he actively co-operated with Canon Percival and other leading citizens in the Evening Classes Association. For many years he was a member of the Governing Body of Clifton College, and President of the High School for Girls, Clifton.\r\n\r\nAdvocate for Better Housing\r\n\r\nAlways in sympathy with the poor, Mr Fry took  a very prominent part in Bristol in the work of the Committee for promoting the Better Housing of the Poor, and was President of that body. Mr Fry did not look to any general housing of the working classes by municipalities as a likely solution to the problem, but considered that where numbers of persons were dispossessed of their houses by improvement schemes, or by legal action on the part of municipal authorities, provisions should be made where necessary for the re-housing of these persons. He held the opinion that housing by municipalities on any large scale tended to create a privileged class of tenants, enjoying greater advantages than other members of the working class who had  to contribute to local taxation. He looked very largely to increased facilities of locomotion and the consequent emigration of the working classes to distant suburbs as an important means of solving the housing problem.\r\n\r\nPolitical Career\r\n\r\nMr Fry served his native city long and well as a Member of Parliament. He was a man of conscientious judgement, of lofty aims and natural dignity, and his motto throughout his distinguished public career was 'Be just, and fear not.' His first entrance into Parliament was in 1878, when, on the resignation of Mr Kirkman Hodgson, who accepted the  Chiltern Hundreds in consequences of ill-health, Mr Fry was adopted by the Bristol Liberal Committee as their candidate, his opponent being Sir Ivor Guest (afterwards Lord  Wimborne). The contest was short but spirited, and over 17,000 voters went to the poll on December 14th, with the result that Mr Fry's majority was 1,547, an increase of over 1000 upon the three previous elections - larger by several hundreds than had ever been polled by any candidate for the presentation of the city since the passing of the Reform Act in 1832. His arrival in Parliament is declared to have had an important bearing on the course of those  memorable political events which culminated in the General Election and overthrow of the Beasconfield Administration in 1880. In the March of that year there were many lively election meetings in Bristol, and the polling took place on April 2nd., with the following result: Mr Fry 10,070, Sir Iver Guest 9,395, Mr Robinson (an independent candidate) 4,100.\r\n\r\nA Keen Contest\r\n\r\nThe year 1885 was an important one in the political career of Mr Fry. By the Redistribution of Seats Act, Bristol was divided into four single-membered constituencies, and on November 25th of that year, Mr Fry contested the North Division, his Conservative opponent being Mr C. E. H. A. Colston. The election was a keenly contested one, and Mr Fry was returned with a majority of 1,064, the number of votes polled by him being 4,110. In recognising the honour, Mr Fry said it was the most gratifying moment of his life to find himself returned to Parliament under such circumstances, a  third time for his native city. It was in 1885 that Mr Gladstone put his Home Rule Bill before Parliament, following which there was a split in the Liberal Party. In a lengthy printed address to his constituents, Mr Fry announced that he did not agree with the Home Rule proposals. He ably defended his views, claimed that his opinions had not changed, and his sincerity was  undoubted. But great bitterness was aroused, and in the course of his electoral campaign as a Liberal-Unionist there were many stormy meetings. After one of these meetings at St. James's Hall he had to be protected from violence on his way to his committee room by the police and his friends. Mr Fry was opposed by Dr Alfred Carpenter, but at the election he was returned by a majority of 850, his votes numbering 3,587. In his speech after the declaration of the poll, Mr Fry said: ' I  believe throughout this contest the majority of the electors approved of the course which I have pursued, but I hardly ventured to suppose we should win this battle with the splendid majority we have.' His published address of thanks contained these words: ' While I claim to have acted from a sense of public duty, I desire to give full credit for a  similar motive to those of my friends and former supporters who have felt bound to oppose me on this occasion; and trust that any unpleasantness that may have arisen in the heat of the constant may now be forgotten.' In 1892 Alderman Charles Townsend  was selected by the Liberals to oppose Mr Fry. There was a prevailing feeling in the country that Mr Gladstone should have the opportunity of formulating another Home Rule Bill, and that was one great influence in determining the election, which went against the Unionist party. Mr Townsend won the election by 345 votes out of 8,473. In his address of thanks to his supporters Mr Fry said the poll was a largely increased Unionist vote as compared with 1886, and 'although defeated I am firmly convinced that the course of events will before long show that the principles we have advocated are right and just. Much as I prize the representation of my fellow citizens in Parliament, I would far rather have lost my seat than have sacrificed my political convictions to party needs or political ambition.' Mr Fry was not destined to be excluded from Westminster for any long period. In July 1895, he was again elected by his old constituency by a majority of 238 over Alderman Charles Townsend. Their respective votes were 4,702 and 4,464. This success Mr Fry termed 'a  signal victory after a severe contest.'\r\nThis was the beginning of the end of Mr Fry's useful Parliamentary career for in 1900 he wrote to Alderman J. Wesley Hall, the Chairman of the Bristol North Unionist Committee, announcing his wish to retire. In his letter he said: ' I need not enlarge upon the reasons of a personal character that have influenced me in coming to this decision. At my age the burdens of public, and especially of political life are not lightly borne; and having rendered twenty years service in the House of Commons as member of my native city, I feel that I may now rightly ask to be relieved from the numerous and absorbing duties and responsibilities which that important position necessarily involves.' The announcement was received with genuine regret throughout the constituency. During his twenty years in Parliament, Mr Fry rendered valuable service, not only to the constituency he so ably and conscientiously represented, but to the State generally. He was recognised as an ideal hard-working member and his work on various Parliamentary committees  was especially valued.\r\n\r\nGrateful Constituents\r\n\r\nAt the end of his Parliamentary career, many were the appreciations of his services. In May, 1901, his constituents presented him with a handsome silver salver and bowls. In the following year a complimentary banquet was given to Mr Fry at the Royal Hotel, at which letters were read from Mr Balfour and Mr Chamberlain, referring to Mr Fry's great services to the cause of Unionism, his firm grasp of public principles, directness of purpose, and absolute and disinterested honesty.\r\nA distinction much coverted, namely to be made a Privy Councillor, was conferred upon Mr Fry in 1901. This was only a few weeks before the death of the late Queen, and Mr Fry was not admitted a member of the Council until after her death, but immediately upon it was summoned by telegram to Marlborough House, where he was sworn in.\r\n\r\nLocal Associations\r\n\r\nMr Fry, who was a member of the Society of Friends, was a Justice of the Peace and a Deputy-Lieutenant for Gloucestershire.  He identified himself with many philanthropic and other public bodies in the City, and was Chairman of the Colston Hall Co., Chairman of the Council of the Bristol Charity Organization Society, a member of the Anchor Society, the General Society, the Benevolent Institution, the School of Science and Art, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Commercial Travellers' Association.\r\nMr Fry, in 1858, married Elizabeth Pease, daughter of the late Mr Francis Gibson, a banker, of Saffron Walden, Essex. That lady died in 1870, leaving two sons and three daughters.\r\nAlthough not so much before the public in recent years, Mr Fry gave active and valued support to various schemes and institutions.\r\nMr Lewis Fry, after his retirement from Parliament, withdrew entirely from public life, and was only seen occasionally in local and other social functions. For some time he was seen driving about, but latterly has been confined to the house. The funeral service on Tuesday at the Cathedral, at 2.30 p.m. will be a public service, and no personal invitations will be issued.",
07/08/1917,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Dr W. J. H. Pinniger,"Dr W. J. H. Pinniger died on Saturday at Widcombe Villa, Richmond Hill, Clifton, after a long illness.

He qualified with the diploma of M.R.C.S. (Eng), L.R.C.P. (London) in July 1905, and took his M.B., B.S. of the University of London, the same year, and his M.D., London, in 1907. As a student he gained many honours, and at the end of his course was awarded the Committee Gold Medal as the most distinguished man of his year. Through practically the whole of his medical career, he was connected with the Bristol General Hospital, having held in succession all the resident posts, including that of Senior House Surgeon during an interregnum, and afterwards as Curator of the Museum and Surgical Registrar. He was also House Surgeon at the Jessop Hospital for Women at Sheffield.\r\nDr Pinniger was at one time on the staff of the Bristol Dispensary but resigned on his appointment as medical officer to Mullers Orphanages, which post he held at the onset of his illness. He was also medical officer to the Bristol Lying in Hospital and Temporary Home.

03/11/1917,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr William Dove Willcox,"A Leading Bristol Tariff Reformer\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce that the death of Mr W. Dove Willcox occurred yesterday at his residence, Brocksholme, Redland Green.\r\nMr William Dove Willcox was a Lancastrian, having been born at Chorley, on the 16th August, 1845, and was, therefore, in his 73rd year. The son of the Rev. P. M. Willcox, he was related on his mother's side to a well-known Lancashire family, which for centuries owned the Bowland estate in the Northern county. After being privately educated, mainly by the Rev. J. S. Boucher, Mr Dove Willcox, coming to Bristol as a youth, entered the leather trade, and became a partner in the well-known firm of Dove and Willcox, leather factors, Victoria Street. With this business he was associated for the whole of his commercial career, helping to make it one of the leading houses in this part of the country. In 1908 following the death of his only son at an early age, he relinquished control of Dove and Willcox, but he did not retire altogether into private life; some connection with and influence in the leather trade being retained by him as a director of Messrs Parker Bros. Ltd., tanners, Bedminster.\r\nFor a long period of years Mr Dove Willcox was a well-known figure in local trade and commerce, and gained the respect of all with whom he came into contact. As an active member of the Bristol Chamber of Commerce and Shipping - of which he was President in 1889-90 and 1890-91 - he did much to promote the interests of the city and port, and his services in carrying through various useful schemes were much appreciated alike by employers and employed. Appointed to the Magisterial Bench in 1894, he discharged his duties as justice of the peace with marked ability and dignity whilst his reputation for fair dealing and impartiality led to his being chosen for the responsible position of umpire to the Bristol Boot and Shoe Trade Arbitration Board, in which post he delivered many important decisions, which prevented trouble and promoted the interests of the trade.\r\nDuring a large portion of his life, Mr Dove Willcox was actively associated with the Liberal Party and a supporter of local organizations with the Redcliff Ward Liberal Association in the days when the ward was a stronghold of Conservatism. In later years he became an ardent advocate of Tariff Reform, mainly through the columns of the 'Daily Press' and in doing so he occupied a fairly large share of public attention. He and the late Mr G. E. Spear were two of the most thoughtful and argumentative of Tariff Reformers in the Bristol district. Mr Dove Willcox being much obsessed with this subject, was disappointed to find that old Liberal friends, who agreed with him in regard to practically everything else, were not convinced by the arguments which he frequently expressed in conversation as well as in public print. In religion Mr Dove Willcox was a Wesleyan of the old-fashioned type, and when a young man he had a strong inclination to enter the ministry. Practically all his life he was associated with Portland Chapel, Kingsdown, of which he was one of the chief supporters. Members of his family have taken a very active part in social and mission work in Bristol.",

09/02/1916,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Rev. Henry Nicholson Ellacombe,"The death occurred on Monday afternoon of the Rev. Henry Nicholson Ellacombe, hon. Canon and Vicar of Bitton. Since March last year, Canon Ellacombe has been in poor health, and only rarely since then has he been allowed to officiate at the Bitton church. Early this year his health became a matter of anxiety to his friends, and early in January it was announced in the 'Western Daily Press' that his condition was becoming critical. His great age militated against him wrestling successfully against a long illness, for he had reached his 94th year. He not only was amongst the oldest of the West country clergy, but also in the long period in holding the same benefice, for he was 65 years vicar of Bitton.\r\nHis work as a churchman was recognised by his being made a Rural Dean of Bitton in 1874, and a Bristol honorary Canon in 1881. The late Canon and his father - who was also a Canon - have ministered at Bitton for the major part of a century, and both father and son were literary men, although their published works were marked by different schools of thought. The late Canon's father was the author of the two large folio volumes of Kingswood Manuscripts, a copy of which has been preserved in the Bristol Central Library, in which he deals with numerous manorial, social and industrial matters concerning Bitton and its environs, including the Kingswood forest. Leading works of his son, the subject of this obituary notice, dealt with floriculture, in which he took delight, and on which he wrote with the pen of an enthusiast. Nothing delighted the late Canon more in his leisure hours than to take some expert gardener over his beautiful Bitton garden and discuss some interesting point of botany. Such visitors came from Kew and other leading botanical gardens in the country, as well as from the continent, and the result of his research was set forth in various interesting works, the best known of which are probably, 'A Gloucestershire Garden', 'Garden Craft in Shakespeare', and 'My Vicarage Garden and Elsewhere'. It is not surprising, therefore, that the village gardeners of Bitton regarded the Canon's words on gardening as an oracle concerning which there was no gainsay.\r\nIn the early Victorian period he took his degree of M.A. following his college life at Oxford. He was a deacon and priest in the Lichfield diocese in 1847, and came to Bitton as vicar in 1850. In many respects he was a typical country vicar, for he always preferred the surroundings of gardens and green fields to those of bricks and mortar. He retained characteristics of the Victorian age, and was noted for his fixity of purpose when he had decided that a course to be pursued was the right one, and on occasion he exhibited a dry tone of humour in his conversation. The older residents will miss a paternal minister and a good friend, and his death removes a leading landmark in the Bitton parish.\r\nThe deceased's family are a son, Dr G. Ellacombe, and several daughters, one of whom is the wife of the Rev. Herbert Cookey, whose benefice adjoins that of Bitton, viz St Anne's, Oldland, and another the wife of Captain Campbell.

22/03/1916,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Henry Wethered,"We regret to announce the death of Mr Henry Wethered, an esteemed citizen, who expired at his residence, Woodland Road, Tyndall's Park, yesterday morning at a quarter to ten o'clock, in his 88th year. His son and daughter were present at the time of his decease.\r\nMr Wethered was born at Little Marlow, came to Bristol sixty-two years ago, and he has resided here since. He never desired a public life, preferring the contentment of his own surroundings, and at the same time striving to promote the happiness of others in an undemonstrative way. When he left his home at Little Marlow he came to Clifton in 1853, and during his business career he had to bear the strain of heavy responsibilities. He, however, found relief in Leigh Woods, which reminded him of the beautiful scenes where his boyhood was spent. He chiefly delighted in studies of the trees which are the glory of that attractive locality.\r\nFor many years the deceased was greatly interested in the coal trade in the neighbourhood of the city. Mr Henry Wethered, with his brothers Joseph and Edwin, joined their brother-in-law, Mr Handel Cossham, in colliery enterprises, first at Parkfield and later at Kingswood; and for a short time, their father, Mr William Wethered, was associated as a proprietor. These collieries, which were developed more and more until they comprised about 3,000 acres of freehold mineral property, and gave employment to an average of 1,500 workpeople, were also interesting from the fact that some important geological discoveries were made in the course of the working. In the year 1878, the firm was turned into a limited company for the purchase of the interest held up to that time by Mr Henry Wethered and his brothers. Subsequently the colliery property passed almost entirely into the possession of Mr Cossham and Mr H. O. Wills.\r\nThe deceased was interested in the management of some local financial undertakings. Forty or fifty years ago he was concerned with the late Mr Williams (accountant) in conducting the Bristol Marine Insurance Company, and for 35 years Mr Henry Wethered acted as director of the London and South Western Bank, whose Bristol branch is at the corner of Corn Street and Small Street.\r\nHe was an ardent Liberal, and took an active part in Bristol elections when Mr Samuel Morley and Mr K. D. Hodgson became the representatives of the city in Parliament, entertaining Mr Hodgson at his residence, Devon House, Kingsdown Parade. Subsequently the deceased removed to 8, Woodland Road, Tyndall's Park, which, with a space adjoining, he purchased, the additional ground enabling him to manifest his love of flowers. Not only did he delight in horticulture, but he manifested talent as a poet as well as a painter. Some of his pictures were exhibited at the Fine Arts Academy in Queen's Road, and as to his poetry, a delicate lyric set to music was appreciated when given at the Victoria Rooms. It is an extraordinary circumstance that not until he was 73 years of age did Mr Wethered give an expression to his poetical feelings; and another curious fact in connection with his attainments was that he was a self-taught artist, and did not handle a brush till he was 49 years of age. He must have possessed an inborn love of Art to have been able to do what he did. In connection with his own work in the direction of painting may be mentioned the circumstance that Mr Swaish, the eminent local portrait painter, was commissioned by Mr Wethered's fellow bank directors to paint his portrait, and it is hung in the board room in London.\r\nThe deceased's sister, Miss Elizabeth Wethered, in 1848 married Mr Handle Cossham. She has been dead some years. His surviving brother, Mr Edwin Wethered, is a Poor Law Inspector, and in that capacity occasionally visits Bristol. His son, Mr E. H. C. Wethered (named after Mr Handle Cossham) is the well-known barrister of the Western Circuit, who has an office in Albion Chambers.",

05/07/1916,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Louis P. Nott,"The death of Mr Louis P.

He married a daughter of the famous contractor, and later became personally responsible for the execution of important railway and dock works. The fact is locally interesting that about the time the Royal Edward Dock was being constructed by the celebrated London firm of John Aird and Co., a Bristolian - Mr Nott - was entrusted with the execution of a corresponding project at Liverpool. At one period Mr Nott was returned to the Council for the District Ward, but remained for a short time only a member of that assembly. To the cause of temperance he devoted much time, and on several occasions headed deputations when it was desired to place before the Licensing Justices the views of those who desired the curtailment of drinking facilities. His interest in temperance work was part of his devotion to religious work in general. On several occasions he lent his support to important missions conducted in this city, and Gideon Chapel - the old place of worship in Newfoundland Road with which Mr George Muller and Mr Cralk were for some time the pastors - in its recent history owed very much to Mr Nott, who assumed a large share of responsibility for its maintenance and services.

25/02/1913,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Arthur Robinson,"We regret to announce the death of Mr Arthur Robinson, which took place yesterday, after a long illness, at his residence at Lawrence Weston House, Henbury. The deceased was a son of the late Mr Elisha Smith Robinson, and a brother of Mr Edward Robinson, of The Towers, Stoke Bishop, and of Mr Kossuth Robinson of Downleaze. He was born in June 1855, and was therefore in his 58th year. He was educated at private schools and in Paris, and in due course he became one of the managing directors of E. S. and A. Robinson, Ltd., wholesale stationers and printers, Redcliff Street and Bedminster, and until his health gave way took a very active part in the control of that important undertaking. He was a man of sound judgement and possessed other qualifications which made him a great personality in the business. His death will be much regretted, not only by his colleagues on the board, but also by the members of the staff and the employees generally.\r\nIn his earlier days Mr Robinson was a keen cricketer, and will be remembered as one of the giants of the game locally - literally as well as figuratively - at the time when Clifton could put out a side stronger than many county teams. Mr Robinson, with tremendous reach, was a batsman who might have met with much success in the first-class game could he have spared the time. As it was, his experience of county play was limited to a few games in 1878, when he had the satisfaction of heading the Gloucestershire averages. Those were the days when one had to be a really good cricketer to get into the County XI, for the three Graces, F. Townsend, W. O. Moberly, W. R. Gilbert, Midwinter, J. Cranston, and other famous cricketers were all at the top of their form. Mr Robinson, although not able to devote much time to county play, devoted himself keenly to the interests of the Clifton Club, and the greatest period of the success of this well-known old club was during his term of captaincy. He was a man of magnificent physique, a heritage which has been handed down to his son, Mr Douglas Robinson, who also possesses his father's love for the national game, and has played for his county. Mr Arthur Robinson interested himself in the formation of the Gloucestershire County Ground Company, and became one of the directors.\r\nOf a retiring disposition, Mr Robinson took no active part in public affairs, but quietly and unostentatiously was ever ready to help in a good cause, and many charitable institutions have been helped by his generosity. He was president of the Grateful Society in 1893, and his collection in aid of the funds of that society amounted to Â£897. One of the Bristol institutions in which he took a deep interest was the Eye Hospital. He was a member of the Finance Committee, and spared no effort to help forward the institution in every way.\r\nAbout two years ago Mr Robinson's health began to give way. He was the victim of an internal complaint, which proved to be incurable. He went to reside at Brighton for a time, in the hope that the change might prove beneficial.

03/04/1913,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr John William Stone Dix,"DEATH OF ALDERMAN DIX\r\n\r\nFATHER OF THE CITY COUNCIL\r\n\r\nWe deeply regret to announce the death of Alderman Dix, the 'Father' of the Bristol City Council, which took place yesterday afternoon at his residence, Hampton Lodge, Durdham Down. Some few months ago Mr Dix had a serious illness which confined him to his house for several weeks, but he recovered, and was well enough to be down in the city as recently as last week. An attack of bronchitis brought on prostration, and on Tuesday it became known that his condition was critical. Yesterday morning he was reported to be sinking fast, and therefore the announcement of his death later in the day did not come as a surprise. Mrs Dix died last Saturday, and it was a sad coincidence that Alderman Dix passed away on the day and almost at the hour of the funeral.\r\nAlderman John William Stone Dix was the son of Mr George Dix, and was descended on the maternal side from the Jefferies family, one of the oldest families in Gloucestershire. He was born at Rose Cottage, Two Mile Hill, now within the city boundaries, in 1831; and was educated at Wesleyan College, Taunton. In 1854 he was admitted a solicitor, and practised at the Exchange Buildings, at one time being largely interested in the working of the Poor Law. The connection of his father with what was originally known as the Clifton Union no doubt brought him into contact with Poor Law matters. About June, 1836, the arrangements of the union were complete, the first chairman being Sir William Miles, who did not long remain in that position, and was succeeded by the Rev William Mirehouse some time in 1837. For more than twenty years the vicar of Hambrook occupied the chair, and he won much praise for the manner in which he conducted the public business. Mr George Dix succeeded, and from 1859 to 1867 remained in the chair. He was very painstaking, and under his guidance the affairs of the union were satisfactorily managed. The work in connection with the removals and settlement of paupers, which Mr J. W. S. Dix conducted, brought him frequently into the courts, and he was a well-known figure at Lawford's Gate. It may be incidentally remarked that the name of Barton Regis came to be adopted for the Clifton Union in consequence of a petition from the lodging house keepers and others who thought persons at a distance from the city would think Clifton parish and the union identical. The name of West Gloucestershire for the union was suggested, but the authorities in London declined to have that, and at last Barton Regis was given as the name and formally announced to be authorized from the 14th of March, 1877.\r\nMr J. W. S. Dix had an extensive general practice in St. George and other localities adjacent. Among the principal cases in which he acted was that in which Mr Sinnott, of Langton Court, took proceedings against the Natham Chemical Company. He was also concerned with the extensive Whittuck estate. A strong Conservative, he took an active interest in politics. He also became deeply engaged in municipal affairs, entering the Council in 1876 as a member for the Bristol Ward, his colleagues being Mr W. K. Whit and Mr George Wills. In 1879 he was again returned for that ward with Mr Wait and Mr Moss Levy, Mr Wills having been transferred to the newly formed ward, St Philip's North. Mr Dix was returned with Mr Wait and Mr E. G. Clarke in 1882, and in 1885 with Mr J. T. Broad and Mr Thomas Baker. He once more was elected a councillor for the ward in 1888. In 1891 he became an alderman of the city, and it may be remarked that Messrs Stock, Bartlett, and himself were chosen aldermen while representing Bristol Ward. Though not a frequent speaker in the Council Chamber, Mr Dix could occasionally speak strongly, and one topic upon which he had a pronounced opinion was the necessity of a stipendiary magistrate for the city. He urged this more frequently when some districts that had been outside Bristol came to be included within the boundaries. The prominent position which Mr Dix held in his party locally led him to be entrusted, with one or two other Conservative members, known as the Warwick Committee, in selecting gentlemen who should be nominated for the office of Mayor, as during many years the Conservatives were in a majority in the Council. The selection of the chief magistrate by one political party in the Council is now a matter of the past. Mr Dix was a member of the present Lord Mayor and Sheriff Selection Committee, and other Council committees of which he was a member were the Watch, New Streets, Sanitary and Improvement, and Parliamentary Bills.\r\nA movement which found Mr Dix an energetic supporter was that which led to the removal of the old swing bridge over the Froom at St Augustine's and the formation of Colston Avenue and gardens at the Tramway Centre. Before the alteration, which had been brought forward several times in the Council, was ultimately adopted, meetings of the citizens in favour of it were held, and Mr Dix at these was a strenuous advocate of the change. He was connected with some local business undertakings, and from being one of the directors of the Bristol Gas Company for many years he became chairman, and had the satisfaction of seeing the offices of the company transferred from the somewhat inconveniently situated structure at Canon's Marsh to the handsome edifice adjoining Colston Hall. On January 23rd last year an interesting gathering was held at the offices of the Bristol Gas Company, at which Mr Dix was presented with a portrait of himself, executed by Miss May Rivers. About 70 officials of the company were present, and Mr John Phillips, who presided, referred to the continuous progress and prosperity of the company during the 23 years Ald. Dix had been a member of the Board, and bore testimony to the great kindness and consideration the staff and employees had always received in his hands. Ald Dix made a felicitous speech in acknowledging the gift. He expressed his appreciation of the kindness of the officials, not only for the nice things which had been said of him and the way in which his name had been received, but also for the great honour which they had done him in making him such a handsome present. He added that he looked back with the greatest pleasure upon his connection with the company, and reminded them that he attained his majority in the proceeding March, having then been chairman for 21 years. Oliver's Limited, formed to take over the business of Mr D. S. Oliver, wine and spirit merchant, was another undertaking over which he presided. He was a Freemason, being a member of the Royal Sussex Lodge of Hospitality, 187. He was appointed a magistrate for Bristol in 1888.\r\nThe subject of archaeology possessed stimulations for him, and when Mr John Reynolds organised his archaeological excursions, sometimes to the Continent, Mr Dix took part in the researches with enthusiasm. Subsequently he became a member of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society, and attended some of their seminar meetings.\r\nAs a lover of horticulture, Mr Dix gave much attention to the cultivation of indoor and greenhouse plants.\r\nHe was three times married. His first wife was Miss Bryant, and they resided at Whitehall. After her death he lived with his father at Rose Cottage. His second wife, who had been Miss Brain, only lived nine months after their marriage. Subsequently he was wedded to Miss Peters, and by her he had two sons, one of whom died in infancy. The other, Mr Hardcastle Dix, was well known, especially in the Commercial Rooms. He will be remembered by his careful meteorological observations. His death was keenly felt by Mr J. W. S. Dix. A sister of the deceased married Mr Sibly, master of the Wesleyan Collegiate School, Tanton, and on e of their sons, Mr Thomas Dix Sibly, who was articled to his uncle, was a solicitor of Bristol, having offices in the Exchange. His death occurred a year or two ago, and was much felt by Mr Dix.",
08/07/1913,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Joseph Storrs Fry,"DEATH OF MR J. STORRS FRY\r\n\r\nA GREAT PHILANTHROPIST\r\n\r\nWe deeply regret to announce the death of Mr Joseph Storrs Fry, which took place last evening at his residence, 16, Upper Belgrave Road, in his 87th year. Mr Fry had been in failing health for a considerable time. During the last week he had gradually become weaker, and the end came very peacefully at about half-past eight last evening.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MEMOIR\r\n\r\nMr Joseph Storrs Fry was born on the 6th August, 1826, in Union Street, in one of the houses which are now incorporated in the immense pile of buildings devoted to the business of the firm that has gained world-wide reputation. The manner in which the old and the new are blended in this thoroughfare is a curious feature of other parts of the city, for passing through the old section of the building wherein Mr Joseph Storrs Fry was born, one looks out upon substantial piles of modern buildings which have arisen to take the place of ancient domiciles and their squalid surroundings. When young, Mr Fry was for a time with Messrs Fletcher and Co., accountants, on the Exchange, the office subsequently occupied by Messrs Curtis and Jenkins until they removed to Corn Street. He here acquired those habits which were found by him so useful when he with his relatives came to control the vast factory in Union Street and Nelson Street. Practically he spent the greater part of his life in the immediate locality, and lived to witness many developments. He was the eldest son of Mr Joseph Fry whose other sons were Sir Edward Fry (who became a Queen's Counsel, and after a distinguished career at the Equity Bar, was raised to the bench in 1877, and made a Lord Justice of the Appeal Court in 1883); the late Mr Albert Fry (who for many years was managing director of the Bristol Wagon Works), and the Right Hon. Lewis Fry. Mr Joseph Storrs Fry, with his brother (the future judge), went to school in Park Row. His cousin, Mr Francis James Fry, who was associated with him in business, has for some time resided at Cricket St, Thomas, in Somerset. Mr Joseph Storrs Fry, who was unmarried, resided with his mother in Charlotte Street, Park Street, and subsequently at Upper Belgrave Road, Durdham Down. His form was well known in Bristol.\r\nHe stood erect under his load of years, a great English manufacturer and a noble illustration of a true Christian. A keen business man, as any could perceive who happened to meet him in the countinghouse, one who took account of the expansion alike of the export trade and its industrial environments, and withal a thorough illustration of what a man should be who took to heart the 'Sermon on the Mount'. One of the 'Signposts of Success' in 'Cassell's Magazine' contained the advice of Mr Joseph Storrs Fry, whose prescription was brief, but involved much. 'To sum,' he said, 'I give as some of the real secrets of success: Firmness of character, unflagging industry, and unfailing reliability in all relations in life, to which must be added a constant endeavour to work only for the noblest ends.'\r\n\r\nPHILANTHROPIC ENDEAVOURS\r\n\r\nIf anyone ever deserved the appellation of being a philanthropist it was Mr Fry; his benevolence was bounded by no limitations of creed or sect, and by no considerations of locality. Indeed, with the Frys philanthropy is not a merely casual thing. It is with them, as has been observed, a principle resting upon a sense of duty to those about them and to the city in which they have for more than two centuries striven and thrived. Nor is their benevolence confined by such bounds, since far and wide they have made their name synonymous with practical charity. As to Mr Joseph Storrs Fry, it only needed a cause to want support, and to require the open hand as well, as the sympathetic heart, for him to extend his bounty. Not that he imparted his wealth indiscriminately, or was ready to contribute towards any object that might be brought under his notice, without having first satisfied himself of the genuineness of the appeal and the bona fides of those who might back it up. Some years ago, in spite of his care, he had been victimized by a young man who had not only obtained money from Mr Fry, but also  from certain other philanthropic gentlemen. The offender happened, however, to fall into the clutches of the police, and he was tried before the Recorder of Bristol, at that time Mr A. R. Poole. Mr Fry was called upon to give evidence, and having made his affirmation in the witness-box, the Recorder, addressing him, said that he was known to be a philanthropist. Mr Fry admitted it, but qualified his statement by remarking that he would not have it supposed he gave assistance without first making inquiries. So widely known was the deceased gentleman's liberality towards deserving objects that in his private room, Union Street, he found himself each morning confronted by a formidable mass of correspondence. The letters were gone through in a systematic manner, and help extended in every instance which appealed to the donor's sense of the need. It scarcely requires recording that such associations as the Bristol Benevolent Institution and the Grocers' Benevolent Society found in him a liberal supporter. When any great calamity occurred involving suffering to a large number of persons, Mr Fry and his firm were sure to be noble contributors; and whether the event happened in this country or abroad, the open hand would be extended.\r\n\r\nA MAN OF BROAD SYMPATHIES\r\n\r\nWhile a consistent member of the Society of Friends, Mr Fry sympathised with all kinds of movements which commanded themselves to his judgement, and so thoroughly did this become known that he was constantly in request to preside over gatherings of different religious bodies. Anniversaries of missionary societies; breakfast meetings for specific objects, such as extending a welcome to some celebrated personage accredited by the churches, or for discussing particular aims, as the abolition of the opium traffic, were certain to find in him a ready supporter. He was a warm friend to the large Bible class for adults in connection with Old Market Street Wesleyan Chapel, presided over by Mr C. R. Parsons, and sometimes delivered addresses to the class. He was specially drawn towards the Young Men's Christian Association, and the original building in St James's Square, and the fine structure at Totterdown owed much to his liberality.\r\n\r\nLITERARY PROCLIVITIES\r\n\r\nHis philanthropic disposition was manifested in respect to Bristol University. Speaking at the opening of a Wesleyan Mission Bazaar at the Broad Weir Hall in May, 1909, he alluded to the charter for the Bristol University by the Privy Council which had just been granted. He said he was sure they must be all delighted that they now had the honour of being a University city. That event must be very gratifying to them all, and not only had they to thank those who were still living, but some who laboured in the past were no longer with them to rejoice at such a happy culmination of their hopes and aspirations. That might seem to be an event far apart from the interest of the present moment, but he did not think it was quite so far from their interest that day as it appeared to be, for he was very glad to notice that men of the highest intellectual and academic culture were giving serious and earnest attention to a solution of some of those problems of social and religious life which concerned those who lived in great cities. The establishment of a University therefore might in no small manner minister to the somewhat similar work in which they were engaged in furthering that afternoon.\r\nMr Fry always possessed a great liking for poetry, and himself made attempts to rhyme. The Society of Friends have their Meeting House on ground once part of the Dominican Friary. A poem written in his younger days by the deceased narrates how the abbot 'still and sad' in his lonely hall had a dream, a premonition of the time when 'the fair hall' should be in the hands of\r\n\r\nMen who wholly act at naught,\r\nAll the church has ever taught,\r\n\r\ntheir heresy even extending to allowing 'that a woman too may preach.'\r\n\r\nWITH HIS WORKPEOPLE\r\n\r\nAny one meeting Mr Fry at the many religious and philanthropic meetings which he attended, and where the promoters were only too delighted to have him upon their platforms, might perhaps fancy that his sympathies for general objects of an ameliorative tendency precluded any close attention to the well-being of the numerous people in the employ of his firm. Such a supposition however would be altogether at variance with the facts. A religious service is held at the factory every morning at nine o'clock, the service consisting of prayer, the singing of one or two hymns, and a short address, which, when Mr Fry delivered it, was particularly impressive. The address in the large hall was frequently given by him, other services being conducted by earnest men who had been connected with the firm during a long series of years.\r\nTo see Mr Joseph Storrs Fry to particular advantage was when a huge tea meeting given by the firm to the workpeople took place. Remembrances of these mammoth gatherings in the original large Colston Hall will abide while life lasts in the breasts of those present upon the deeply interesting occasions. Though a bachelor, he invited the wives to accompany their husbands, no fewer than three evenings being required to accommodate the entire company, spacious as the building might be. Mr Fry presided, and had the Mayor of Bristol on his right hand. To sketch the proceedings, it might be said that after tea the National Anthem was sung heartily, and then the evening would be chiefly devoted to sacred song, addresses by well-known Church of England clergymen, Nonconformist ministers, and others who were known as effective platform speakers. Mr Fry, of course, had something to say to the guests, and every word the aged and beloved gentleman uttered was listened to with profound interest. A sentence from his address at one of these meetings may be quoted, 'I am persuaded that it is the Divine purpose that our business life should not interfere with, but rather be a help to, the spiritual life'. In that utterance the character of the generous employer was as strikingly expressed as it was possible to convey it.\r\n\r\nFREEDOM OF THE CITY\r\n\r\nIt was a distinction well deserved by the recipient when Mr Joseph Storrs Fry was presented with the Freedom of the City. Upon September 14th, 1908, the Lord Mayor (Mr Edward Robinson) submitted to the Council a resolution in favour of conferring the honorary freedom of the city upon Mr Fry and Mr H. Overton Wills, and it met with unanimous support, the action of the Council being heartily endorsed by the citizens. A special meeting was arranged for October 29th in order to admit the new freemen and present them with their certificates. The ceremony, which took place in the new Council Chamber, was impressive, the only matter for regret being that Mr H. O. Wills was unable to attend.\r\nWhen Mr Fry was informed in September that the Council decided to confer upon him the honorary freedom of the city, he wrote to the Lord Mayor a letter, in which, after expressing his thanks for the distinction, he continued:-\r\n'Although I cannot claim to have performed public services for my own city or the country such as those who have fallen to the lot of others who have previously received a similar honour to that which has been bestowed upon me, I can yield to none of them in love for the city in which I was born and in which I have lived during the whole of my long life, or in earnest desire for the welfare of its inhabitants. It is my conviction that the real welfare of the community depends upon the acceptance by its members of those principles which affect the fundamental conditions of life and character, and with this view I have felt it my duty to devote a good deal of my time and attention to matters which relate to the moral and spiritual condition of the people, and that message of Divine love in the Gospel of Christ which is the balm of the healing of the nations. I have been much touched by the manner in which my fellow citizens have accepted your proposal, and can assure them all that whilst fully recognizing the honour which has been conferred upon me, I am deeply conscious of my own many shortcomings, and hope that the remaining days of my life, which are not likely to be many, may be more faithfully employed in any services which I am capable of rendering'.\r\n\r\nREMINISCENCES OF A LONG LIFE\r\n\r\nThe speech which Mr Fry delivered on the occasion of being presented with the freedom of the city contained some interesting reminiscences. In the course of his remarks, he said:\r\n'In thinking of the city in which he dwell, I have been led to just cast my thoughts back to the condition in which the city was, and its inhabitants at the time I came into the world, now rather more than 83 years ago. At that time the population of Bristol - the old city and the surrounding districts all of which, I suppose, have now been embodied in the present city of Bristol - must have been something between 80,000 and 90,000. Since that time the population must have increased fourfold, and the condition of things in almost every respect has changed. I have often even felt - as I daresay all who are my age have felt - that I live in another world than that in which I was born. Everything seems to have changed: in many respects - I will not say in all respects - for the better (Hear, hear). I am not a pessimist. Old men are sometimes praisers of the past, and naturally so. We look back upon our youthful enthusiasm with pleasure: we do not remember the troubles: we chiefly remember the joys of the past. Yet on looking back upon the past, as far as I can remember it - happy as it has been mostly under God's mercy - I can recognise the great progress that has been made in almost every direction. In the development of human resources and industries; education, and almost every part of human life seems to have expanded and grown during that time. When I was born in Bristol there was no railway, no railway station. It was not until several years after that the portion of the Great Western Railway which connects with London was opened. I myself travelled by the first public train over that part of the Midland Railway which was then the old Bristol and Gloucester Railway, in the year 1846. Then, of course, we had no telegraphs or telephones, and the communication with all parts of the world was very inferior indeed to what it is now. The fastest coach between Bristol and London I am informed by the present pastmaster, took 11.5 hours to accomplish the journey. The cost of a letter from London was ten pence, and the cost of letters to more distant places was proportionately higher. The educational affairs of the city were in a very imperfect condition. There were some good schools even then, and I was a scholar at the old Bristol College, which, expiring, I suppose, from want of support, was replaced afterwards by another college. The educational institutions then were very different from those we now enjoy. Elementary education was exceedingly deficient. There were a few schools, but a large number of boys and girls grew up without any opportunity for education. What became of them afterwards one does not know. Now, happily, owing in a large degree to the liberality of Mr Wills, the educational facilities are crowned with the University, and the poorest boy or girl may climb the educational ladder from the most excellent elementary schools, through the various grades of education, to the highest rung that can now be reached. And although there are many things remaining which could be other than they are, still I do not take a pessimistic view of the present condition of the world, but a rather hopeful one. I am afraid sometimes we are wanting in gratitude to those who devote themselves to the interests of
the city, and I am taking the opportunity, which I may never have again, of expressing what are my own feelings, and the feelings, I believe, of all right-minded citizens, that we are under a strong sense of indebtedness toward you gentlemen, who are devoting so much time, energy, ability, business tact, and power to the business of our city. You have to develop the resources which have been opened up for your use. This city, although so greatly increased in population and size, is capable of much further development. Almost all interests of every kind - commercial, educational, and benevolent - require assistance and the cooperation of all who are willing to assist in the spreading of happiness and blessing among those with whom they live. Therefore I earnestly desire that you may be prospered in the great work you have in hand, and that the ability may be given you to discharge all your duties. You have a great work in the development of the port. With regard to the resources of our new dock, all the business energy and ability you have will be required to keep pace with the growing commerce of the world, that we may have our share, and take our place in the future as we have in the past amongst the great cities of the Empire.'\r\n\r\nIN PRAISE OF PIETY\r\nAt the Christian Endeavour Convention in Bristol, held on May 31st 1909, the deceased was invited to speak, and delivered a genial address in the course of which he said that he looked upon movements of that kind as lying at the very root of national welfare and prosperity. When Robert Burns was selecting a topic for one of his greatest poems, he chose a very simple theme: he just described in the 'Cottar's Saturday Night' a simple Scotch labourer in his humble cottage on a Saturday evening opening the Bible and conducting his simple family worship with prayer and praise in the humble home. 'From scenes like these old Scotia's grandeur springs' - he attributed the grandeur of Scotland not to physical force or even the learning of her people - the poet spoke rightly, because he felt the great springs of national welfare lay in the homes and lives of the people of the country, and that when they relied merely upon physical forces they were greatly mistaken with regard to the great motives which underlay all human progress. So he  looked upon that movement in connection with Sunday school work and other Christian institutions - of course placing the Church of Christ foremost - he looked upon that movement and those often silent and unobserved influences, as great springs of action.\r\nNot merely during what may be called the active period of existence did Mr Fry by example demonstrate the serious character of life. For beyond what had come to be considered the allotted period he was busy in a private and public capacity in the cause of benevolence. For a short time laid aside through illness, he resumed his career of usefulness directly the medical advisor allowed him to quit his residence. It seemed little short of a miracle to listen to him soon after at a nurses' gathering held in the General Hospital. His address was excellent, and although the delivery of the words manifested great weakness, he kept the interest of his hearers unabated. Even when he had, through physical inability, to be assisted on to the platform, he put in an appearance at religious and philanthropical gatherings, with the objects of which he sympathised.\r\nSo Mr Fry made his influence felt by gentle and earnest endeavours. He was the friend of every good cause, and whether it was a small private benefaction, or a gift of thousands of pounds, whether it was some little mission room in the slums of Bristol, or a great scheme like Bristol University, he was equally interested. The things that made for the betterment of the people were all great to him.",
02/01/1913,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Charles Newth,"We regret to announce the death of Alderman Charles Newth, J.P., which took place yesterday afternoon at his residence, Woodside, Redland Grove, in his seventy-second year. The son of the late Mr John Newth, Mr Charles Newth was born at Bristol in 1841. He was educated locally, and commenced business in 1876 as a wholesale cabinet maker. The business was conducted for many years at premises in Broadmead which are still retained at showrooms, but rapid developments made it necessary, several years ago, to acquire much larger premises, and the works are now carried on in an extensive range of buildings extending from Milk Street to Callowhill Street, and two sons - Mr Arthur E. Newth and Mr Herbert Newth - are partners in the business which is carried on under the style of Messrs C. Newth and Sons.\r\nFor fifteen years Mr Newth was a member of the old Board of Commissioners for the District Ward, and performed good and active service. He was elected to the Bristol City Council for the District Ward on the retirement of Mr Charles Townsend in March, 1893, and continued to represent the ward until December 1908, when he was elected an alderman. He has served on several of the Council committees, including the Overseers and the Watch Committees. He was also a justice of the peace, his name having been added to the Commission in 1902.\r\nIn politics he was an ardent Liberal, and held for some years the position of Chairman of the District Ward Liberal Association and treasurer of the Bristol North Liberal Federation. He was a member of the Bristol Incorporation of the Poor for eight years, and took a great interest in the administration of the Poor Law, especially affecting children and the inmates of the workhouse.\r\nHe was a member of the Baptist denomination, a deacon of City Road Chapel, of which he was also treasurer, a vice-president of the Sunday School, and for many years superintendent. Mr Newth was also noted for his interest in matters appertaining to music and choral societies. He was a man of kindly disposition and endeared himself to a very large circle of friends. His health broke down about four years ago, but for which he would in all probability have been selected for the honourable position of Lord Mayor of his native city. A long period of rest led to an improvement in his health, and he was again able for some months to resume his municipal duties, but a few weeks ago there was a relapse, and for some days it had been known that his condition was extremely critical. Had Alderman Newth been spared until June, he would have celebrated his golden wedding.\r\nAt yesterday's meeting of the City Council a vote of condolence with the family of the late Alderman Newth was passed.",
27/03/1913,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Clifton Bingham,"The death of Mr Clifton Bingham which occurred suddenly yesterday, put to silence one of the 'sweet singers' of the West Country. Mr Bingham was a member of an old Bristol family, and his earlier adventures in authorship were made through the columns of the 'Bristol Observer'. But story writing - though he took fairly high rank as a fictionist - was not Mr Bingham's metier. He was a master of a peculiar felicity of expression in verse, especially when dealing with the sentimental aspects of life, and it was, therefore, as a song-writer, that Mr Bingham established his reputation, which was world-wide. His smooth lines and delicate thoughts lent themselves well to the maker of music, and Mr Bingham was fortunate in finding several composers who were closely in sympathy with his own ideals, enthusiasms, and methods of expression. Thus the songs of Mr Clifton Bingham winged their way to the furthest corners of the earth, and they were like the arrows, shot at random, that fall into the pleasant places. Mr Bingham was a perfect master of his craft, and though there may be a subtle distinction between poetry and versification for the purposes of musical treatment, it must be conceded that Mr Bingham did much to obliterate the line of demarcation, and to raise the literary standard of what in early Victorian times was known as the ordinary 'drawing-room ballad'. Mr Bingham was a talented balladist, but he was more than that. From the multitude of songs of which Mr Bingham was the author it would be difficult to make a brief list of those which were intrinsically the best. But the palm of favour fell to such ballads as 'In Old Madrid', 'Love's Old Sweet Song', and 'The Promise of Life'. The popularity of these and some others is perennial, and the songs should constitute Mr Bingham's chief contribution to the minstrelsy of his own land.",
07/07/1915,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr William Nichol Reid,"It is with very deep regret that we have to announce the death, yesterday, at his residence, Woodcote, Tyndall's Park, of Mr William Nichol Reid, after an illness extending over three months.\r\nMr W. N. Reid, who was the only son of Mr Walter Reid, the proprietor of the 'Western Daily Press', the 'Bristol Evening News', and the 'Bristol Observer', had been engaged in journalistic work all his adult life, with the exception of two prolonged journeys, one to the United States and Japan, and the other to South Africa, taken in the interests of his health, which at these times was not robust. Educated at the Bristol Grammar School under Dr Caldicott, Mr Nichol Reid always maintained the keenest interest in his old school. He was a promoter and a most active supporter of the Grammar School Old Boys' Society, of which he was President two or three years ago. Everything connected with the school had his heartiest sympathy, and there was no more loyal 'Old Boy'. Deeply interested also in religious and philanthropic work, Mr Reid was limited in his activities only by considerations of health. For years he was a Sunday school teacher at Highbury Chapel, and for years also was a leading spirit in the Bristol Housing Committee, which advocated legislation that has now been partially accomplished, and endeavoured to see that the laws that tended to the welfare of the poor in the matter of housing were effectively administered. His sympathies with religious and philanthropic work were wide, and embraced many various forms of beneficial activity. His concern for the physical as well as the moral welfare of the young men engaged in the printing trade was marked in his presidency of the United Press Cricket Club, for which in former years he played, and the fortunes of which he followed with unfailing zest. A member of the Institute of Journalists from its foundation, he was at the last annual meeting elected President for the current year of the Bristol District, which covers a wide area, and every member will deplore the close of his useful career.\r\nThe references hitherto have been to the sympathies and activities that have been known to his many friends outside the walls of the office of this paper, but those who have been associated with him in journalistic work, especially those whose connection with him has extended over many years, realise how completely and devotedly he applied all his powers to the business of his life. With practical acquaintance of more than one department of journalistic work, he brought long experience to his duty in later years of carrying on in conjunction with his father, whose partner he became, the management of the affairs of this office. No more careful and conscientious worker ever lived, but his friends and colleagues think with affection and respect chiefly of the high moral qualities, the unvarying kindness of his manner, the deep desire for the welfare of every member of the staff, the manifest aim to do his duty with a deep sense of responsibility, which he displayed. It would not be seemly for those who have been connected with him for long years in daily work, to express publicly their full sense of the loss they have sustained by his death. But the friends of Mr Nichol Reid who have known and esteemed him in connection with work and enterprises outside the ordinary duties of his occupation will be ready to believe that those who were brought into more intimate association with him will never cease to cherish the affectionate memory of a life that was always inspired by sincere attachment to right and duty.\r\nMr Reid leaves a widow to whom the staff of the 'Western Daily Press' desires to extend its deep and respectful sympathy.",
01/06/1915,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Francis Frederick Fox,"DEATH OF A MUCH RESPECTED CITIZEN\r\n\r\nLONG AND USEFUL CAREER\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death of Mr Francis F. Fox, one of the most respected citizens of Bristol, and one formerly prominent in many of its activities. He passed away on Sunday night at his residence, Yate House, Yate. Mr Fox was eighty two years of age.\r\nFrancis Frederick Fox was the second son of Francis Ker Fox, M.D., of Brislington House. He was born March 15th, 1833, and was educated at Bath and Shrewsbury. For many years he was head of the firm of Francis Frederick Fox and Company, oil and colour merchants, 22, Little George Street, Froom Bridge, Bristol. He married Alice, eldest daughter of Mr Richard Jenkins Poole King, of Kensington House, Brislington, who was rightly regarded one of the leading Bristolians about forty years ago, as besides being the head partner in the firm of Messrs King, African Merchants, Redcliff Wharf, he was President of the Conservative Association, and one of the most prominent members of the City Council.\r\nMr F. F. Fox, in addition to great business ability, gained in his private capacity a high reputation in the Council. He was elected alderman from 1865 to 1871, and again in March 1875, onwards. He remained in the position for a long period, and during that time proved his usefulness as a public man upon several occasions, coming forward prominently during the discussions concerning the rival docks in 1882. The undertakings at Avonmouth and Portishead were competing strongly for the ocean trade, and at length as the city suffered seriously through the rivalry, a Harbour Trust Association was proposed to unite the docks into one property under the supervising of a board. This proposition was defeated in the Council, but at length public opinion amongst the uncompromising attitude of the two dock companies made itself felt, and at a subsequent meeting the competition between the city and the two dock companies, and the squandering of Â£25,000 a year as a scandal and reproach to all, moved that the Mayor (Sir Joseph Weston) be requested to communicate with the belligerents with a view to an equitable arrangement. Alderman Fox's resolution was adopted unanimously, and the Mayor's intervention put an end to the conflict.\r\n\r\nA MODEL OF WHAT A COUNCILLOR SHOULD BE\r\n\r\nMuch regret was expressed in the Council Chamber when the deceased intimated his intention of ceasing to be an alderman. After Council assembled December 10, 1901, a letter was received from him resigning the position which he had held during thirty-two years. The Lord Mayor made some feeling remarks relative to the service rendered by  Alderman Fox, and proposed a resolution recording high appreciation of the ability and courtesy which he displayed in dealing with questions coming from time to time before the civic fathers. In seconding the proposition, Ald. William Pethink said that they looked upon Ald. Fox as a model of what a member of the Council should be.\r\nSeveral members gave expression to their high appreciation of the departing civic ruler before the resolution was cordially adopted. Every note of praise that was sounded in the Chamber found a responsive echo in the hearts of the citizens when they read what was stated in the local journals. The opinion was expressed that when men of his calibre, earnestness of purpose, and tireless perseverance had earned the reward of repose, would it not be well that their memory and bright example should be perpetuated for the benefit of the emulative generations that are to come? In the course of the discussion in the Council, the suggestion was thrown out that the busts of such men should occupy a niche within the precincts of the Council Chamber.\r\n\r\nOTHER PUBLIC WORK\r\n\r\nThe deceased was Master of the Society of Merchant Venturers in 1877 and 1878, and he was followed in that capacity by Sir George William Edwards, Mr Charles Bowles Hare immediately preceding him. For a long period Ald. Fox resided at Yate House, Chipping Sodbury, and he was not only a magistrate for the city of Bristol, but also for the county of Gloucester. He became a justice of the peace for Bristol in March, 1878, and several citizens of mark were appointed at the same time, most of whom pre-deceased him. Other public appointments held by Ald. Fox were those of a trustee of the Municipal Charities and a commissioner of income tax. In 1869 he was president of the Grateful Society, his collection amounting to Â£703, which was less than that of Mr J. P. Gilbert, the president for 1868, though considerably more than the amount received by Mr John Hellicar, who presided in 1870. He was president of the Parent Society, an association chiefly of Redcliff men who keep in remembrance the name and work of Edward Colston, in 1879. The extent of Ald. Fox's knowledge of local matters was considerable, and on account of his urbanity he was frequently appealed to for information. When the Rev. Alfred B. Beaven prepared his work 'Bristol Lists: Municipal and Miscellaneous', he dedicated it to Ald. Fox 'who both by his private researches, and in his official character, has done so much to create and foster a more general interest in the history of our city'. Mr Beaven in his preface, expressed a sense of the deceased's kindness in giving him access to his valuable collection of Bristol books, as well as in supplying information from his vast store of personal knowledge of men and things in relation to the last half century of local history. Ald. Fox was sheriff of Bristol for the year 1880-81.\r\n\r\nLOVE FOR ARCHAEOLOGY\r\n\r\nArchaeology possessed great charm for the deceased, who spent a considerable amount of money and time in the pursuit of his favourite study. No more earnest member of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society could be found, and he rendered excellent service upon the council of the society. In July, 1900, when the Archaeologists met at Bath, he was elected president, and delivered an interesting address at the Guildhall, the retiring president being Mr G. S. Bazley. He further evinced his desire to do what he could to render that meeting of the society a success by giving an address at night on 'Hood Screens' with limelight illustrations. When Sir Brook Kay, Bart., ceased to be president of the council, Mr Fox was chosen for the position. It must have been in accordance with his antiquarian proclivities that on August 10, 1882, and while he was living at Madeley House, Clifton, he presided at the dinner of the Gloucestershire Society held at the Grand Hotel, Broad Street. The society, established in 1857, did much good through the benevolence extended to the poor women and by apprenticing lads to trades. The time-honoured ballad, 'Georges Ridler's Oven' was invariably sung at the 'Gloucestershire Feast', and the covert allusions to Cavaliers and Roundheads had their usual points emphasized under the presidency of Mr Fox. Though the society still exists, the dinners have ceased to be held. During some of his later years the deceased, through increasing deafness, was compelled to relinquish some of his public engagements.\r\n\r\nBOOKS ON BRISTOL GUILDS\r\n\r\nOccasionally he ventured upon authorship, his principal work being 'Some Account of the Ancient Fraternity of Merchant Taylors of Bristol, with Transcripts of Ordnance, and other Documents', the title page stating that the book 'was written by Francis F. Fox, late Master of the Society of Merchant Venturers and one of the Trustees of the Merchant Taylors'. Written in 1890 there were 50 copies printed by J. Wright and Co., Bristol, for private circulation. The deceased dedicated his work to Mr John Taylor, of the Bristol Museum and Library, saying in the introduction that to him was entirely due whatever credit attached to the compilation, as he originated the idea of examining the records of the Merchant Taylors' Guild in Bristol. He stated that Mr Taylor's judgement selected the information most worthy of notice from the records. Mr Fox added that he hoped the work might survive as a memorial of their friendship.\r\nAnother book pertaining to a local guild was 'Some Account of the Guild of Weavers in Bristol, edited by Francis F. Fox, of Yate House, and John Taylor, City Librarian'. This volume was privately printed and published ny William George's Sons, Park Street, 1889. The work was inscribed 'to the master, wardens, and commonalty of freemen of the art and mystery of cloth workers of the city of London', as some acknowledgement of the interest they had shown in the University College of Bristol.\r\nThe literary side of Mr Fox's character was very pronounced, and he delighted in the atmosphere of a library. When he went to reside at Yate House he commissioned a Bristol building firm to erect a spacious room adjoining the mansion, and this was fitted up in a fashion calculated to gladden the hearts of all book lovers. Some thousands of volumes - many rare, and all good editions, were here carefully arranged. Few occasions afforded Mr Fox more gratification than having given the 'open sesame' to this portion of his dwelling to an inveterate devourer of printed matter to listen to the pleased astonishment of the visitor at seeing so goodly a collection of works. When the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society had a meeting in the neighbourhood they were entertained by Mr Fox, and spent considerable time in appraising the legacies bequeathed by dead authors. There was no more distinguished trait of Mr Fox's character than his urbanity. He could never be other than courteous, and a more popular gentleman never occupied a civic position in the city of Bristol.",
13/09/1915,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr T. Sherwood Smith,"TRIBUTE TO A LONG LIFE WELL SPENT\r\n\r\nMr T. Sherwood Smith, who passed away at his residence, Gloucester Row, Clifton, on Friday evening in his 94th year, was buried yesterday afternoon at Arno's Vale. The interment was preceded by a service at Buckingham Baptist Chapel, Clifton, where deceased was a regular attendant in recent years, having formerly worshipped at Counterslip Chapel. The service was conducted by the Rev. E. L. Hamilton (pastor) assisted by the Rev. J. H. Rees (Counterslip).\r\n\r\nA NOTABLE CITIZEN\r\n\r\nThe Rev. J. H. Rees gave an address in which he said that in the death of Mr Sherwood Smith, Bristol had lost one of its finest and most notable citizens. After a career of varied interests and of high integrity of character and purpose he came to his grave full of years and full of honours. They did not mourn for their friend. He had laid down the burden of the long years and laid it down with a will. The task was o'er, the race run, the course completed, and no vain regrets remained. He just waited the Master's call Home. There could be no sadness of farewell that he had crossed the bar and met the Pilot face to face. He would not wish to do so, and therefore, they would rather think with thankfulness of the long voyage and of the wealth of the voyage as he entered the haven to receive his Lord's 'Well done'. He breasted many a storm in his day as those who put principle before place always had to encounter. He fought many a hotly-contested battle for the ideal, as he saw it, and always with clean hands. He had the soul of a reformer. The passion of conviction glowed like lambent fires within him. The men of conviction and loyalty to the highest were always men of progress. They were the heralds of the better day coming. Self was lost in the larger interests of the community, in the common good. Mr Sherwood Smith was a man of open vision and therefore a man who never ceased to grow. The price of old age was the peril of growing old, old in spirit and sympathy, the peril of lingering with the memories of things that had passed on and became absorbed in the new movements of advancing time. But their friend retained to the last his youthfulness of spirit, his enthusiasm of things that mattered in the life of today. Not that he refused to dwell lovingly upon the past or refrained from recalling the stirring days of his more active life. He was rich in reminiscences, but he never lost sight of the prospect. He kept an open widow towards Jerusalem. He was a pilgrim of hope, and thus he was the comrade and encourager of youth. The old warrior gloried in every response to the trumpet call for wider liberty and a purer state. He rejoiced in the younger hands that carried the banner of progress to battle. The speaker added that he need not enter into any particulars of his career. Those had already appeared in the 'Daily Press'. Sufficient to say that at the root of all he was and all he did faith in God was found as the impelling motive, as the constant inspiration and unfailing resource of his life. That faith was also expressed in humble devotion to the Saviour and profound regard for the interest of the church, particularly the church of his adoption. He was the friend of every good cause. He loved all men and feared none. He was a gentleman by nature, and grace preserved and enriched that nature until it shone with a clear steady and unfading radiance. They honoured and thanked God for the memory of a noble man, who lived out his life as the light. That day they laid the tabernacle of clay in which he dwelt in the keeping of mother-earth until the day dawned and the shadows fled away, but the man, the spirit of him that moved and thought and felt and knew the thrill of living and doing, lived on in the eternity of God.\r\nPrayer was offered by the Rev. E. L. Hamilton.",
11/08/1915,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr William Acraman Greenslade,"SUDDEN DEATH OF MR W. A. GREENSLADE\r\n\r\nBy the death of Mr William Acraman Greenslade, which happened with tragic suddenness at Liverpool on Saturday, Bristol has lost a citizen who for many years has been held in the highest esteem. A week ago to-day a small company of friends - gentlemen well known in professional and commercial circles - entertained him to a farewell dinner, for Mr Greenslade was sailing on the following Friday for a business tour in America. The gathering was a singularly happy one, and the 'few words' spoken in proposing the health of the guest of the evening served but to show how singularly popular Mr Greenslade was. Two days later Mr Greenslade, accompanied by his wife, travelled North. They stopped the night at Chester and went on to Liverpool on Saturday morning to embark on the steamship by which the deceased was to travel to America which sailed in the afternoon. Mr Greenslade was not feeling well, and his condition became so much worse as they were driving to the docks that it was deemed advisable to stop at the house of a medical man. Before the doctor could be seen, however, Mr Greenslade expired, heart disease being the cause of death. Needless to say the news, which only became generally known in the city yesterday, was received with the deepest regret.\r\nMr Greenslade, whose firm - E. A. and W. Greenslade, brush manufacturers, of  Thomas Street - is well known and has been considerably developed in recent years, was keenly interested in the commercial development of Bristol, and in this connection experience gained during trips to Canada and America was turned to good account. He was a member of the Council of the Chamber of Commerce, and identified himself zealously with developments undertaken by this body for the furthering of the trade of the port. By his attendance at the Chamber of Commerce he was held in the highest esteem, and his presence will be greatly missed at the offices in Small Street as well as at the Commercial Rooms, the Liberal Club, and other spheres of activity with which he was associated.\r\nSince the war Mr Greenslade has given abundant evidence of his great [unclear]. Three of his sons have been called as commissioned officers to the colours, one being a prisoner of war in Germany. As a member of the Bristol Citizens' Recruiting Committee he was in daily touch with the work being done at the Guildhall, and as late as on the day he left Bristol - he was at the Recruiting Office. His desire to do something for soldiers who, through injuries sustained in battle, were unable to follow their usual vocation in life, led him to make an offer to the War Office to train a number of men in brush making, guaranteeing them a certain wage, with the prospect of their becoming expert workers and thus gaining their own livelihood.",
13/11/1915,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Alderman Joseph Pembery,"A FRIENDLY SOCIETY STALWART\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death of Alderman Joseph Pembery, a man who has been prominent in the friendly society movement for many years, and who has also devoted considerable attention to civic and social matters.\r\nMr Pembery was born on November 27, 1842, in St. Paul's. Neither the State nor the municipality had then assumed responsibility for the education of the young, and the boy missed the advantages that are offered to twentieth century children. At the age of nine he commenced to earn his own living, and at 18 he married, and in the course of time became the father of nine children. His earlier employment was connected with the goods departments of local railways, but afterwards he transferred his attention to the coal industry, became a foreman to Messrs Cossham and Wethered, and afterwards acted as a local agent for the group of collieries with which Mr Cossham's undertaking became linked. Persevering effort, combined with natural ability, stood him in good stead, his interests became more extended as life advanced, and his connection with a friendly society was an early step towards public work.\r\nHe joined the Ancient Order of Foresters on March 11, 1863, by becoming a member of Court Garibaldi. He is said to have filled every office open to him in that Order, and eventually became its senior trustee. He also served as trustee of the Widows and Orphans' Society, and of his own Court. He has again and again acted for the Foresters in a representative capacity, and has been helpful by his knowledge and suggestions in the practical work of the Order. The Foresters' High Court was held in Bristol in 1893, and Mr Pembery, as High Chief Ranger, conducted the proceedings at the Colston Hall. It is interesting to recall the fact that among the leading citizens who assembled at the opening to show a spirit of welcome to the visitors were the Mayor (Alderman W. R. Barker), the Sheriff (Mr A. Deedes), Sir Joseph Weston, M.P., Mr Lewis Fry, Mr Fuller Eberle, and Mr Mark Whitwill. The Mayor, in his speech, referred to the 'sturdy character and sterling worth' of the High Chief Ranger, and Mr Lewis Fry, among others, also spoke in most eulogistic terms of Mr Pembery. During his term of office as High Chief Ranger Mr Pembery was entertained at a complimentary banquet by Court Garibaldi and presented with an illuminated address. Among the valued mementoes of his year of office were an address to him by the Oddfellows of Taunton, and one handed to him at the Bristol High Court from the officers of the Bristol District of the Manchester Unity of Oddfellows. In 1913 he celebrated the jubilee of his connection with the friendly society movement, and public references were made to his long and useful service.\r\nIn politics Mr Pembery was a robust Liberal; he was identified with the Congregational denomination, and took much interest in the brotherhood movement. He had long lived at Bedminster, and in 1894 was returned at a November election as Councillor for the East Ward of that populous district. He won the esteem of his constituents and others who knew him, and had a pleasant evidence of this when a number of Bedminster residents, irrespective of party, joined in presenting him with an illuminated address, accompanied by a gold chain and locket. This was the outcome of a spontaneous desire to recognise the value of his municipal work. In 1911, on the death of Ald. Barker, he was chosen as one of the Aldemanic body, and in that capacity had a seat in the Council until the end of his life. Of late he had served on the Watch and Sanitary Committees. He had been a magistrate since 1894 but sometimes jokingly told his friends he had always been a J.P.\r\nMr Pembery has of late suffered from bad health. At one time he was absent from the City Council for a considerable period owing to serious illness, and he felt deeply the heartiness of the reception with which he was greeted on his re-appearance in the Chamber. A few days ago he was taken with a serious illness, from which there was little chance of his recovery. He passed away about 9.45 last evening.",
26/01/1916,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Very Rev. Francis Pigou,"DEATH OF THE DEAN OF BRISTOL\r\n\r\nFEATURES IN A LONG AND INTERESTING CAREER\r\n\r\nWe regret to have to announce the death of Dr. Pigou, the Dean of Bristol. It is common knowledge that he has for a long while been in very poor health, and his condition became worse towards the close of last week. For several days prayers were offered on his behalf at the Cathedral. He passed away yesterday afternoon at 4.30 while the Cathedral service was proceeding, leaving a widow and two daughters to mourn the loss. The Dean was born in January, 1832, and was therefore 84 years of age.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MEMOIR\r\n\r\nThe Very Rev. Francis Pigou, D.D., Dean of Bristol, was born at Baden-Baden in January of 1832, being one of a family of seven, each of whom, with the exception of the eldest son, Major General Pigou, was born abroad, the father, a retired officer of the Queen's Bays, showing a strong liking for the Continent, where he, with his family, lived for many years.\r\nThe Dean's earliest education was received at Neuweld, on the Rhine, and on the family removing to the Hotel d'Angleterre, Spa, he was sent to the Grammar School at Ripon, making the journey from Spa to London alone at the tender age of ten years. Before setting out on the journey his parents had carefully instructed him as to his movements. On arrival in the Metropolis he was to call a cab. This he did, and his first experience with a London cabby showed that the boy was possessed of grit and tact. He asked what the fare to Paddington would be, and the cabby told him 5s, but on the journey the driver opened the trap door, and announced to young Pigou that there would be an extra charge of 2s 6d for portmanteau. The exorbitant amount startled the youthful passenger, but he kept his counsel, and did not attempt to argue the matter. On arrival at Paddington, however, he sought the cab inspector, and the result of the interview was that instead of having to pay 7s 6d, he only had to pay 3s 6d, and the cabman received a lecture for trying to impose on the boy.\r\nFrom Ripon young Pigou was sent to Cheltenham College, then in its infancy, and this was the scene of many a happy adventure, for as a high spirited lad he entered thoroughly into all the fights and all the games indulged in by the College boys. Here, too, he studied hard, but strange to say he never succeeded in winning any prize: his prize was to come later in life, and when it came, in the shape of election to a life membership of the College, it was an honour the Dean very highly appreciated, as he did also his election to the presidency of the Cheltenham Society. Leaving Cheltenham he went to Edinburgh Academy, where he studied under the late Archdeacon Williams and the Rev. Dr Hannah. His next step was to the famous Divinity School at Trinity College, Dublin, where he went through a very stiff course of reading. Whilst still at Trinity his father died, and his widowed mother and sisters then left Dublin and came to reside in Pembroke Road, Clifton.\r\n\r\nHIS FIRST CURACY\r\n\r\nHaving taken his degree in 1853, he was ordained deacon two years later. Then came his first curacy, being appointed to Stoke Talamge, a lonely Oxfordshire village, where the rector was an old man of 92. The parish church was in a shocking condition - 'very small, very dirty, and untidy. Cocks and hens roosted on week-days in the pulpit. The choir consisted of a trio of violin, flageolet, and long French horn'. In his desolate position the curate amused himself with his harmonium, and being a student of natural history, gave 'cottage lectures' with the aid of his microscope.\r\nAt the age of 26, shortly after he had taken Priest's Orders in the parish church of Aylesbury, he was offered and accepted the chaplaincy under Bishop Spencer of the Marboenf Chapel, in Paris, and for some time he ministered among the English residents and visitors. While in Paris he became very friendly with Mr Loyson, formerly Pere Hyacinthe, of the Whitefriars, whom he considered was more an orator than a preacher. He also made the acquaintance of the Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Mary. The English community made efforts to purchase the Embassy Chapel in the Rue d'Aguesseau to present to the young chaplain, but at the last moment the scheme fell through on account of objections raised by Lord Cowley, and he found himself obliged to return to London, where he accepted the curacy of Vere Street Chapel, but shortly afterwards became curate at Kensington parish church under Archdeacon Sinclair.\r\nTwo years later Mr Pigou received his first preferment, on the death of Canon Repton, to the Incumbency of St, Philip's, Regent Street. In this year, 1860, he married his first wife, and took up his residence in Suffolk Street. It was in St. Philip's that the Dean preached a sermon on the death of the Prince Consort, a copy of which was sent by command to her late Majesty, the Queen. Amongst his congregation were the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Mary, Mr Gladstone, Lord Derby, and, in fact, most of the men and women of light and leading in London crowded to his church. It was quite the fashion to go to the proprietary chapel by Howell and James's. There was scarcely a charity in London for which he had not pleaded in St. Philip's Church. He held this position for 11 eleven years. Mrs Pigou died in 1881, and in the following year he married the daughter of Mr William Gambier of Sarcombe, Herts.\r\nThe Dean had the distinction of several times preaching before the late Queen Victoria, the first time at Windsor on the Sunday after the Thanksgiving Day for the recovery of the then Prince of Wales. He evidently pleased her Majesty, for in 1871 he was appointed her Honorary Chaplain, and she sent a message saying she would like to hear him again and hoped he would be less nervous and less hurried. In 1874 he was appointed Chaplain-in-Ordinary to the Queen, and preached twelve times before her Majesty, who was always a most attentive listener.\r\nThe Dean's next important move was to the vicarage of Doncastor in succession to Dr. Vaughan, who had accepted a Membership of the Temple. Doncastor was a difficult parish, but Dr. Vaughan had been responsible for many reforms, so that the Dean found plenty of work to do to maintain the improved moral and religious tone that prevailed on his acceptance of the vicarage. Dr Pigou became very popular in Doncastor, and when other preferments were offered to him, all sorts of inducements to stay were held out to him, including Â£500 a year offered by a local gentleman. Eventually, however, the more important vicarage of Halifax was offered to the Dean by the Crown, and accepting it in 1875 he remained there as vicar until 1891.\r\n\r\nTHE DEANERY OF BRISTOL\r\n\r\nDean Pigou stayed at Chicester for three years, and of his life there he wrote: 'I sometimes thought a large Dissenting Chapel with a first-rate preacher would rouse Chicester more than anything else, for wherever Dissent is active the Church is alive!' With this feeling the Dean fell day-dreaming about the future. 'Sitting over my fire one October evening, wondering as I had wondered years ago, in my first curacy, if God would call me to any higher work in His Church, my wife said to me, - 'If God were to say to you, 'Ask what I shall give thee', what would you ask for?' I replied 'Send me to Bristol'. His wish was fulfilled, for shortly after this conversation, the late Lord Salisbury offered him the Deanery of Bristol, and he was duly installed at a memorable service in the presence of a large representative gathering on December 11, 1891. Of his splendid work in Bristol there is little need to say much - it is well known. He did much for the Cathedral, both as  regards the fabric and making it a centre of religious life. The nave services on Sunday nights, which he introduced, are very popular, and altogether the attendances at the services are much larger than when he first came. To use his own words, he says: 'In every way possible, besides statutory services, ordinations, and confirmations, our cathedrals should be utilized as ours, I may with truth say, is at Bristol. I hold Bristol Cathedral to be for all working purposes a model - indeed, almost an ideal cathedral. I doubt that any cathedral in England is more used for large gatherings'. He had not long been in Bristol before citizens became aware of the great energy of their new Dean, and the fact was more noticeable from the comparative quietude of the later years of his predecessor's career. Dr Pigou made speeches in aid of a variety of causes, preached many sermons, and showed his indifference to the popular demand for a short discourse. He was keenly interested in congregational singing, and viewed with regret the tendency for this part of the service to be left largely to the choir. He was quite at home seated at a harmonium playing a hymn tune, and leading the singing with a rather powerful voice. He was a man of wide sympathies, loved a good story, and had a good sense of humour. He shared with the late Dean Stanley a reputation for writing that was a terror to those who were called upon to read it. This was particularly the case in his later years, after long illness produced its effect upon his powers. By his engaging personality, and his many interests, he won the admiration of Bristolians, and his death will be deeply regretted not only by Churchmen, but by all denominations in the city. His career has been a remarkable one for he has preached to all sorts and conditions of men, from before the Queen down to slums and thieves' kitchens; in cathedrals and theatres; to the many in a crowded church, and to workmen and navies. The Dean so loved his cathedral at Bristol that he wrote in the concluding chapter of 'Phases of My Life' :- 'If when I shall be under the green sod, the citizens of Bristol should care to perpetuate the memory of their present Dean, I would say Bristol Cathedral ought not to be without its peal of bells, which could now be safely put into its solid centre tower, and only rung, even though my ears should never hear their peal or chime. Meanwhile I await my time, until, after a ministerial life of perhaps unique variety and experiences, I be laid to rest with others who have gone before under the shadow of a Cathedral which has been my constant thought and care, and in the midst of a people I have loved and humbly sought, in the Masters's name and for His sake, to serve'.",

04/03/1910,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Pierrepont Harris,"DEATH OF MR PIERREPONT HARRIS\r\n\r\nA PROMINENT FREEMASON\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death of Mr Gilbert Woodruff Pierrepont Harris, of Boscawen, Brislington, which took place yesterday morning at a nursing home in Clifton, to which he had been removed for medical treatment. The deceased was formerly in business as a Manchester warehouseman in Bridge Street, under the style of Harris Brothers, and his father and uncles were connected with the city.

20/01/1913,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr James W. Arrowsmith,"DEATH OF WELL-KNOWN PUBLISHER\r\n\r\nWe regret to have to announce the death of Mr James W. Arrowsmith, one of Bristol's best known and most respected citizens. Mr Arrowsmith, although not a native of Bristol, had been resident here since his boyhood, and had become identified with many of its activities. His business faculty and readiness to assist in the initiation of new ventures again and again led to his co-operation being secured in connection with local movements. His interests were varied, and in many spheres of local activity he will be sadly missed. For some time his health has been unsatisfactory, and rather more than a week ago his illness led to serious apprehensions. A stroke followed, and his condition was deemed to be so serious that the impending anniversary dinner of the University Colston Society was postponed. His death occurred last evening about half-past five, at his residence, Upper Belgrave Road.\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF 'CALLED BACK'\r\n\r\nMr Arrowsmith was born at Worcester in 1839 - soon after the commencement of the Victorian era - and came to Bristol with his father 14 years later. There was then carried on in this city a printing business under the title of Evans and Abbot, and with this concern Mr Arrowsmith, senior, became connected, the name afterwards becoming Evans and Arrowsmith. Although Mr J. W. Arrowsmith's early life was mapped out with the idea of his being a builder, he not unnaturally before long found a place for his energy in his father's business, of which he speedily took the management, and in due time became proprietor. As a publisher, Mr J. W. Arrowsmith was brought into sudden prominence in the book world by the wonderful success of 'Hugh Conway's' novel 'Called Back'. The story has been told more than once, but it just now has a special interest. Mr Arrowsmith had, as an experiment, issued a Bristol Annual. The first number bore the title, 'Thirteen at Dinner', and tradition represents it as the outcome of a special gathering at which the festive party each agreed to make some contribution to the venture. The result, from a financial point of view, could not be regarded as encouraging, and in the second attempt, instead of a series of short narratives, a lady novelist supplied a story for the Annual. When the arrangements for the third of the series were in sight, Mr F. J. Fargus, a friend of Mr Arrowsmith's, offered to write it. It has been often said that the postscript of a lady's letter is usually the most important part, and it is noteworthy that this offer was apparently the result of an after-thought when Mr Fargus was communicating with the publisher on another matter. It read as follows:-\r\n'P.S. - If you have not settled your Annual for next year, I will write it for the same you paid - and give you whole copyright.'\r\n\r\nThe offer was accepted and the story written. Then came the selection of a title, and on this Mr Arrowsmith was consulted. Fargus quickly made a variety of suggestions, 'Clouds', 'Light from Darkness', 'From Darkness to Light', 'Scattered Clouds', 'A Method in his Madness', and 'Dawn - at last', being amongst them. None of them found favour, and other proposals were not regarded as particularly happy until 'Called Back', was proposed, and this was adopted. It was, however, scarcely a case of the title making the book famous by its powerful appeal to public curiosity and interest. The immediate outcome did not promise a phenomenal success, and the change has been directly attributed to a favourable reference in a society paper, 'Truth'. A curious feature is that the notice which accomplished so much was apparently not written in the ordinary way of a review of a book sent by the publisher to the editor, but was the result of an interest awakened in the mind of some one connected with the periodical by a lucky accident.\r\nThe account of the incident that appeared in 'Truth' will bear repetition. 'Who Arrowsmith is and who Hugh Conway is I do not know, nor had I heard of the Christmas Annual of the former, or of the latter as a writer of fiction, but a week or two ago a friend of mine said to me, 'Buy Arrowsmith's Christmas Annual if you want to read one of the best that have appeared for many a year'. A few days ago I happened to be at Waterloo station waiting for a train. I remembered the advice and asked the clerk at the bookstall for the Annual. He handed it to me and remarked, 'They say the story is very good, but this is only the third copy I have sold'. It was so foggy that I could not read it in the train, as I had intended, so I put the book in my pocket. About two that night it occurred to me that it was nearing the hour when decent, quiet people go to bed. I saw the Annual staring me in the face, and took it up. Well, not until 4.30 did I get to bed. By that time I had finished the story. Had I not, I should have gone on reading. I agree with my friend - nay, I go further than him and say that Wilkie Collins never penned a more enthralling story ... I can only hope that Mr Hugh Conway will soon be good enough to write another story - a better one of its kind than 'Called Back', however, neither he nor any one else can write. I only ask that it should be one half as good.'\r\nThe novel had been published as the Christmas Annual of the Bristol Library Series in 1883, and after this introduction to the public notice it sold like wildfire. About 400,000 copies were quickly disposed of, and it was translated into French, Italian, Dutch, and German languages. Mr Joseph Shaylor, in 1912, became the author of a volume called 'The Fascination of Books', and it dealt largely with incidents connected with publishing. He mentioned 'Called Back' as one of two illustrations in which a Press notice has played an important part in the fortunes of books, the other being 'The Fight in Dame Europe's School'. This was a brochure written during the Franco-German war, and after being declined by many European publishers, was finally issued 'in the country'. A very small edition was thought sufficient, but a review in the 'Times' sent up the demand until 400,000 copies were disposed of. The name of Mr Arrowsmith as well as that of 'Hugh Conway' (the 'nom de plume' adopted by Mr Fargus), became famous as the result of their successful co-operation, and it should be noted that the terms of the postscript already quoted did not prevent the publisher adding to the author's remuneration by a royalty on each book sold. Thus in the next three years 'Hugh Conway', instead of the Â£80 agreed upon, received Â£2,450. The return would haver been larger to both publisher and author but for the fact that the book was pirated in the United States, international copyright law being then insufficient to prevent this abuse.\r\n\r\nSUCCESS FOLLOWS SUCCESS\r\n\r\nWith the lesson of 'Called Back' before their eyes many writers who under an older order of things would have naturally looked to London publishers turned Bristol-wards, and found in Mr Arrowsmith both a good literary judge and an excellent man of business. So work grew - and grew out of all likeness to its former proportions, and success followed success. Other well-known books published by Mr Arrowsmith have had large circulation. Mr Anthony Hope's 'Prisoner of Zenda' reached 250,000, and its sequel, 'Rupert of Henteau' also proved popular, well over 100,000 copies being issued. These were more expensive volumes than 'Called Back', which was among the pioneers of sixpenny books enjoying great popularity. Another story published by Mr Arrowsmith which had a great run was 'Three Men in a Boat'. A quarter of a million have been printed, and the demand is not at an end. Among other works published or printed by Mr Arrowsmith are George Grossmith's 'Society Clown', 'The Wizard', by Mr Rider Haggard; 'Ziska' by Miss Marie Corelli; 'Katharine Regina' by Sir Walter Besant; and Mr Edwin Dingle's 'Explorations in China'. He has also been responsible for works by Mr Grant Allen, Mr F. A. Anstey, Mr Wilkie Collins, Mr B. L. Fargoon, Mr Harry Furness, Mr Andrew Lang, 'Max O' Rell', Mr Gordon Stables, Mr Arthur Roberts, and Mr John Strange Winter.\r\nDr W. G. Grace's 'Cricket' from some points of view may be regarded as one of the Bristol books that have come from Mr Arrowsmith's press. 'Arrowsmith's Dictionary of Bristol' was found so useful in its earlier form that an enlarged and improved edition was issued, the information, collected from a variety of sources, being revised by Mr John Latimer up to a certain stage in the preparation of that work. Mr Latimer's Annals were published elsewhere, but the supplement bringing up the first volume to the close of the nineteenth century was printed at Quay Street, and Mr Arrowsmith took the responsibility of producing 'Sixteenth Century Bristol', material for which had been prepared by Mr Latimer for newspaper use and revised by that painstaking historian. 'A Short History of the Port of Bristol' was written by Mr Charles Wells at Mr Arrowsmith's request, and he was also the publisher of Mr Stanley Hutton's book, 'Bristol and its Famous Associations'. 'The History of the Bristol Grammar School', the life of Dr White (founder of Temple Hospital), and the History of the Red Maids' School, all by Mr W. A. Sampson, and 'A Geological Excursion Handbook for the Bristol District' by Prof S. H. Reynolds, were printed by the firm. The list of books and booklets which bore the impress of the firm is extremely large. Besides those mentioned may be named 'Bristol, Past and Present', by Taylor and Nicholls; 'Pleasant Trips Out of Bristol', by Mr Nicholls; the publications included in the Arrow series; a number of guides to Bristol; and the first railway time-table in this city to adopt the A.B.C. arrangement. The firm responsible for this amount of work has in recent years been formed into a limited company, but the old traditions were not forgotten, and the jubilee of the concern was celebrated in January, 1912.\r\n\r\nSHOOTING AND AMATEUR SPORT\r\n\r\nThe claims of a growing business did not absorb the whole of Mr Arrowsmith's energies. He never entered the City Council, took no part in Poor Law Administration, and never occupied high office in the Chamber of Commerce - avenues by which many men enter the public service; yet he was connected with a surprising variety of movements in which the community was interested and had been a justice of the peace since 1886. He served for 21 years in the Bristol Rifle Corps, of which he was one of the early members, and afterwards joined the Volunteer Engineers. In both battalions he was famous as a marksman. In 1868, 1870, and 1873, his skill with the rifle won him a place among the 80 who were privileged to enter for the final stage for the Queen's Prize. That coverted prize itself never fell to his lot. In 1873 he tied with three others for the  Hopton Challenge Cup, and the prize was divided. He was in the International Twenty in 1883, and again in 1885, and he had the honour of shooting in the English Right for the Eluko Challenge Shield. In the Engineers, he became Quartermaster, and showed a continuance of his skill as a shot. In 1883 he secured the Curtis and Harvey Prize, and in 1888 brought back the Albert Jewel - one of the leading awards at the Wimbledon meeting. His score on that occasion was the best on record. He was hon. secretary of the Bristol Long Range Club, and of the Bristol Martini Shooting Club.\r\nCricket interested him greatly. His firm has been represented for a long series of years at Gloucestershire county matches in Bristol, and has printed the score cards, while at the end of the season it has issued the official scores. A writer, describing his interest in sport mentioned the Cricket Challenge Cup, of which Mr Arrowsmith was the donor upon evidence of this. He was one of the small group of men whose action in 1888 secured Bristol the County Ground at Ashley Down. He was chairman of the company, and of the original members of the directorate he and Mr Harry Beloe were the only survivors. He served on the Gloucestershire Cricket Club Committee, and always showed a keen interest in the fortunes of the county. Bowling appealed to him also. He founded and was President of the Bristol Arrow Bowling Club, the senior organization of the kind in the city, and had served in a similar capacity in the Western Counties Bowling League. Rugby football appealed to him, and he was a supporter of the Bristol Rugby Club. In recent years he has played golf. Indeed, it may be said that amateur sport in most forms appealed to him, and he was one of the foremost Bristolians to initiate or take part in arranging for the entertainment of visiting teams of athletes from our Overseas Dominions.\r\n\r\nPOLITICS; THE UNIVERSITY; AND OTHER ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\nMr Arrowsmith was one of the founders of the Bristol Liberal Club, which took over the premises in Corn Street, formerly used as an Athenaeum. He was chairman of the club for many years, and on his resigning that responsible position was chosen as President. Evidence of the esteem of the club members for him is seen in the institution, in the portrait of Mr Arrowsmith presented to him on their behalf by the Right Hon. Arnold Morley, who at the time was Postmaster-General and President of the club. The portrait occupies a place on the club walls. He was a member of the Anchor Colston Society, and presided at the dinner in 1893, and the collection under his auspices (Â£1,202) exceeded the collections obtained in many years before and after that anniversary.\r\nHe was a also a supporter of the movement for creating a University for Bristol. It had occurred to more than one Bristolian that the educational side of Edward Colston's work was not recognised to anything like the same extent as his philanthropy. In the course of a conservation Mr Walter Reid asked Mr Arrowsmith what he thought of the formation of another Colston Society - one devoted to educational advance. Mr Arrowsmith's horror of multiplying organisations at first made him hesitate to accept the suggestion, but on second thoughts, Mr Reid's idea of a University College Colston Society met with his approval, and steps were taken to carry it into effect.The result was extremely gratifying, for in addition to the useful sum annually subscribed, the new society's anniversary and the speeches delivered by men of national and even world-wide renown on these occasions had an undoubted influence in hastening the realisation of the University scheme. Mr Arrowsmith presided at the dinner in 1906, and Â£1,093 was collected. This is by far the highest amount yet raised at one of these anniversaries, but it is but fair to explain that it included a generous gift of Â£500 from Lord Strathoona. Mr Arrowsmith was a member of the University Council, being appointed by the Court. He served on the Colston Research Committee of the University, on the appointment of the University Colston Society; and was a member of the University Colston Society; and was a member of the University Athletic Ground Management Committee. His interest in the University was recognised by the decision in 1911 to name a new tower of the building in Tyndall's Park after him. The employees of his firm took advantage of this opportunity to indicate their respect by fixing, in October 1912, a beautiful bronze tablet to one of the walls of the tower. The tablet bore the following inscription:-\r\n'By leave of the Council the workpeople of James Williams Arrowsmith of 11, Quay Street, Bristol, printer and publisher, and others connected with him in business, set up this tablet as a mark of their esteem and regard as well as a record, that on the 22nd day of September, 1911, the Council resolved in commemoration of the distinguished service rendered by him to the University, that this tower should henceforth be known as the Arrowsmith tower.'\r\nIt may be added that Mr Arrowsmith had at a considerably earlier period put the eight hours' day system into operation in his great business, and h
d given his employees a pecuniary interest in the prosperity of the concern by a bonus system, stated to be equivalent, on the average, to four or five weeks' extra pay each year.\r\nAmong other movements with which Mr Arrowsmith identified himself was the erection of the Cabot Tower on Brandon Hill; to this he acted as one of the hon. secretaries. He interested himself in several of the local industrial and art exhibitions held in this city, and in the erection of the Colston statue in Colston Avenue. He was a local treasurer when the British Association came to Bristol in 1898, and shared in the honour of an exceptionally successful visit. Sir Norman Lockyer, in  a moving vote of thanks to the citizens for the magnificent general hospitality and admirable arrangements, said these features had eclipsed all previous efforts during his thirty years' experience. Mr Arrowsmith, Mr Arthur Lee, and Dr Bertram Rogers, the trio who had so much to do with this result, were, in January 1899, entertained at a complimentary dinner at the Clifton Spa, and to each, as a memento, an inscribed silver salver was presented.\r\nMr Arrowsmith's wife predeceased him by some years, and he had no children.",

19/01/1909,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Frederick G. Tyler,"The announcement of the death of Mr Fred. G.

He was, it will be remembered, seized with a sudden illness at the Cafe, Wine Street, whilst distributing the prizes to the successful competitors at the Schoolmasters' Cricket Club whist drive, and it was apparent at the time that the case was serious. Mr Tyler was conveyed to his home in an unconscious condition, and he remained until death took place early yesterday morning. For some time past Mr Tyler's health had been a matter of concern to the members of his family, but apparently he made light of the matter himself and was disinclined to be regarded as an invalid. On Saturday evening some of his most intimate friends noticed that he did not appear to be in his usual state of health, yet his exceptional geniality was unimpaired, and almost his last words in giving away the prizes were characteristic of his ready wit and the thoroughness with which he entered into any pleasant social gathering. To the older generation of cricketers in this district Mr Tyler was one of the most well-known figures. He has been connected with the Schoolmasters' Cricket Club for very many years, and although he was rarely prominent as a successful player, his personality was such as to make his presence on the field an inspiration to his colleagues. One of the most successful periods of the second eleven of the Schoolmasters' club was enjoyed under his captaincy, and as president during the past five years he has, with Messrs J. and H. W. Chard and W. R. Powell, been directly concerned in bringing about the feeling of good fellowship that exists amongst the large number of members. Mr Tyler will be sadly missed not only by the Schoolmasters' club, but by many others who have been cheered by his bright and happy temperament. His inexhaustible fund of humour and his kindly disposition ensured the success of every gathering at which he was present, and it would be difficult to name a more popular personality in social and sporting circles. An earnest Churchman, Mr Tyler had been for more than twenty years a regular member of the choir of St. John's, Redland, throwing himself with characteristic heartiness into every effort for the welfare of the church, and in particular for the effectiveness of the musical service. Mr Tyler had taken an active interest in Freemasonry, and was a member of the Moira Lodge, of which he was a Past Master. He had also held the rank of Prov.

Mr Hatton, who died at his house, 15, Elm Tree Road, St. John's Wood, had been unwell for some time past. About a year ago he had a slight seizure, from which, however, he seemed for a time to recover. An internal complaint then developed, necessitating an operation. Mr Hatton may be said to have been cradled in journalism. His father, a London printer, founded the 'Derbyshire Times', the first penny paper to be published in Peakland, and, as Mr Hatton once said, 'My impulse of journalism was sprouted into my inner consciousness in an atmosphere redolent of printers' ink and the sweet perfumes of roll-making, squat type-cases, old Columbian presses, an the first printing machine seen in the wilds of Derbyshire'. After a brief period on the 'Derbyshire Times' not hitting it off with the editor, whom in after years he described as a pedant, he migrated to Bristol at the age of 22.

The deceased gentleman, who was the eldest son of Mr T. D. Taylor, while his health permitted, was one of the most active Bristolians, and interested himself in many objects. In May he went to residence at Clevedon. Two or three months ago he underwent a very severe operation for an affection of the throat; but though it was successfully performed, he never fully recovered his strength. Mr Goodenough Taylor, after a preliminary training in the office of the 'Times and Mirror', removed to the metropolis, where he was on the staff of the 'Globe', and afterwards migrated to the gallery for the 'Morning Post', during the time also being in the legacy department at Somerset House. He was educated at Blundell's School, Tiverton, and among the numerous appointments which he received in his after life none were esteemed more highly by him than his election as one of the governors of the famous school. When he returned to Bristol from London he became a member of the firm who were proprietors of the 'Times and Mirror', and at the time of his death was a director of the limited company who now own the newspaper, his father being chairman. The deceased retained his connection with journalism in London by acting as a member of the council of the Newspaper Press Fund, while locally he rendered good service to the Institute of Journalists, having been president of the Bristol District during the year in which the Institute visited this city. There were few of his associations more valued by Mr Goodenough Taylor than those with the Royal Navy Artillery Volunteers, and he became a member of the first Bristol contingent. When the corps was disbanded, he, with others, considered it a retrograde step, and took a prominent part in the re-establishment of the force. He was appointed a member of the committee to consider the conditions under which it should be reformed; and when the Bristol detachment came to be constituted he was offered and accepted an honorary lieutenancy. Yachting was especially dear to him. He was a member of the Royal Thames Yacht Club, and vice-commodore of the Penarth Yacht Club. Among other appointments which he held, he had been president of the Grateful Society, Master of the Society of Stephen's Ringers, was a member of the Bristol Zoological Society, and chairman of the Bristol Dogs' Home. He was also president of the Commercial Rooms. By reason of affability, he had troops of friends, and he was constantly in request at social gatherings, where he proved an acceptable speaker. Mr Goodenough Taylor was about 60 years of age. He married Miss Slack, a Somerset lady, who predeceased him. He leaves three children, his son, Mr Lionel Taylor (a director of the 'Times and Mirror' Limited), and two daughters.

From his close connection with St. Philip's Church it may be inferred that Mr Board was a staunch churchman, and his great interest in all that related to parochial doings was shown when in an inquiry into the funds arising out of the ecclesiastical property which took place some years ago, the Rev.

Yesterday he seemed to be in very good spirits, but about half-past-five in the evening, his daughter, Miss Hilda Godwin, went to a room at the top of the house, and found her father apparently lifeless, with a six chambered revolver by his side, three of the chambers being empty. Dr Bisder was summoned, and pronounced life extinct.\r\nIt will be remembered that a short time ago Mr Godwin retired from the City Council on account of his health. It was at the meeting of the Council on February 13th that a letter was received from him expressing regret that he found it necessary to give notice of his intention to retire from the City Council, and adding that he should always appreciate the courtesy he had received from the members of the Council. Alderman W. Howell Davies expressed their deep regret at the reason of Alderman Godwin's retirement, adding that he had done very valuable work, and was exceedingly genial in the discharge of his duties. He moved that some expression of the goodwill of the Council be sent to him. This was seconded by Alderman C. B. Hare, and the resignation was regretfully accepted by the Council. Mr Godwin entered the Council in March, 1893, as one of the representatives of the Redcliff Ward, filling the vacancy caused by the resignation of Mr J. E. Jefferies. He had once had to undergo the ordeal of a contested election. That was in 1894, when he and Mr E. B. James defeated Mr Harold Brabham, who came forward as a labour candidate. Mr Godwin resided at Ellinthorpe, Stoke Bishop, and in the Council strongly opposed the extension of the boundaries. He had held the office of High Sheriff and Lord Mayor, and was on the Bristol bench of magistrates. He succeeded Herbert Ashman as Lord Mayor in 1901, when Mr E. B. James (the Lord Mayor of last year) was High Sheriff, and he was subsequently elected as an alderman. Mr Godwin was one of the churchwardens of St. Mary Redcliff, and Mr James was a past warden. Miss Godwin acted as Lady Mayoress during her father's mayoralty.\r\nThe deceased gentleman, who was one of the first pupils at Clifton College, was prominently associated with the commercial life of the city, and was a member of the firm of Messrs Godwin, Warren, Fry, and Co., wholesale iron merchants, of Redcliff Street. It was as a member of the Chamber of Commerce that he first took part in public work. He served the office of president of the Chamber in 1885-6, and it was during his presidency that, in response to repeated applications by the Chamber, the Midland and Great Western Companies opened the section of the Clifton Extension Railway from Clifton Down to Avonmouth for passenger traffic, it having previously been used for goods only. Mr Godwin was formerly Liberal in politics, and was chairman of the Anchor Society in 1885. When, however, the split took place in the Liberal party over Mr Gladstone's Home Rule measure, he became a Unionist and as chairman of the Bristol South Conservative Association was an ardent supporter of the Right Hon.

After Mr W. H.

The deceased gentleman was one of the oldest accountants in the city, and he did much to place the profession upon a high level. In the seventies his name was frequently before the public as an arbitrator and an umpire, and indeed his well-known fairness, combined with an unfailing courtesy, always made troublesome and frequently complicated arbitrations to be conducted smoothly. One of the last matters referred to him was the celebrated local case of Lorymer v the Corporation in which Messrs Lorymer Brothers, corn merchants, claimed recompense as frontagers for the loss of water space when the Council decided to arch that part of the Floating Harbour between the Drawbridge and the Stone Bridge.

He was also a member of the committee of the Bristol Dispensary and of the Benevolent Institution. He was a Nonconformist, and took an active share in the erection of Christ Church, Sneyd Park, besides contributing to its upkeep. Music possessed great charm for him, and during a long term of years he was connected with the Bristol Orpheus Glee Society, and when he could no longer appear as one of the choir, he was elected an honorary member, the other honorary members being Mr W.

Tyndall, which occurred early yesterday morning at her residence, The Fort, Tyndall's Park. Considerable historical interest attaches to the house, which has been the home of the Tyndall family for several generations. Since the death of Miss Sybil Tyndall only a short time ago, Miss Mary Tyndall has occupied the house with her sister, who is also well-known for her many acts of charity. Another sister is Mrs Ord, the wife of Colonel Ord. The Misses Tyndall have been identified with the Children's Hospital ever since the institution has been at its present quarters on St. Michael's Hill. The deceased lady was a member of the committee of management and took an active part in the work. She frequently visited the hospital, and at the annual meeting of subscribers a week ago regret was expressed by the president at the fact that illness prevented her from attending. She had been present at a committee meeting on February 6th and in the same week she was seized with an illness that proved fatal. The poor have lost a kind and sympathetic friend, and among other institutions the District Nurses' Society, which has a nurse always at work in St. Michael's, has lost a valued supporter. She contributed to various parochial organisations - in fact very few subscription lists for charitable objects closed without the name of Miss Mary Tyndall being included.

12/12/1912,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Henry Daniel,"DEATH OF MR HENRY DANIEL\r\n\r\nA LONG AND USEFUL CAREER\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death of Mr Henry Daniel, which occurred yesterday morning at his residence, Victoria Villa, Tyndall's Park. Mr Daniel had not enjoyed good health for a considerable time. He went to Clevedon for a while, and came back apparently in improved health. This however was not maintained. For some little time his condition had given rise to growing anxiety, and the worst fears have now been realised.\r\nMr Henry Daniel had been so long before the citizens of Bristol that he was connected with a generation most of whom passed away some years before him. He was a native of Westbury-on-Trym, born in 1826, and was educated privately. Quite a lad when he came to this city, he early became associated with Mr Samuel Alexander, one of the leading auctioneers, valuers, and surveyors. In its early days the business was carried on at 49, Broad Street, under the style of Alexander and Son. In 1790 it was established by Mr Alexander's grandfather. As a valuer of very great repute in the West of England, Mr Alexander had been engaged in many important negotiations. For some years his most prominent work was in important compensation cases arising out of street and other public improvements. He obtained considerable assistance from Mr Henry Daniel who during upwards of fifty years was connected with, and on the death of Mr Alexander in April, 1888, became senior partner in, the firm of Alexander, Daniel, and Co. During his long career as an auctioneer and valuer, Mr Daniel was enabled to see several flourishing businesses similar to his own pass away. Among those who were successful auctioneers when he entered into partnership with Mr Alexander were J. Fargus and Son (afterwards Fargus Brothers), 4, Clare Street; W. Roue, 18, Park Street; S. Sprod, Baldwin Street; G. Standerwick, 8, Union Street; J. C. Wallop, Nicholas Street; J. Nash, 11 Bridge Street; G. C. Harril, 27, Broad Street. A few prominent firms that then flourished are still in existence, as for example, Barnard, Thomas and Co., (Albion Chambers), now Tribe, Clarke, and Co.\r\nThe business of Alexander, Daniel, and Co., continued to advance, and the fine saleroom in Broad Street (at present occupied by Messrs George Nichols, Young, Hunt, and Co.) became quite a centre of attraction through the frequent important sales by auction carried on there. When Mile's Banking Company relinquished their extensive premises in Corn Street, in consequence of amalgamation with Cave, Baille, and Co., Messrs Alexander, Daniel, and Co., became processors of the former bank premises, which are at the present time occupied by the United Counties Bank. Mr Daniel retired from business in 1896. He was a many-sided man, and besides attending closely to the details of a comprehensive undertaking with his partner, Mr Alexander and subsequently with Mr Pritchard, he found time to engage in many other pursuits.\r\nA staunch Liberal, he became chairman of St. Michael's Ward Liberal Association, his residence in the Ward, at Victoria Villa, Tyndall's Park Road, naturally causing himself to be allied with the political organisation in St. Michael's. He was induced to come forward to represent the Ward in the City Council, and he remained a councillor from 1882 to 1891. His connection with the Liberal Party was further emphasized by his becoming treasurer and president of the West Bristol Association, and a vice-president of the Bristol Liberal Thousand. In 1886 he was chosen president of the Anchor Society, being immediately preceded by Mr J. Colthurst Godwin, and followed by Mr Edward Robinson. Other appointments which the deceased held were those of chairman of the Grand Hotel Company, honorary auditor for several philanthropic institutions, among them the Bristol Royal Hospital for Sick Children and Women, the National Benevolent Institution, and the Bristol Benevolent Institution. He was president and honorary treasurer of the Kingsdown Provident Dispensary; and one of the Charity Trustees.\r\nMusic possessed a particular charm for Mr Daniel, and when a young man he became a member of the choir of Old Market Street Wesleyan Chapel. Upon the establishment of the Presbyterian Church in Bristol, and before the erection of the structure upon St. James's Parade, Mr Daniel occasionally acted as precensor at the services held in the Broadmead Rooms. Some of his happiest hours were spent at the rehearsals of the Bristol Madrigal Society in the long room at the Montague Hotel, Kingsdown, and during many years he was one of the vice-presidents of the society. His memory was retentive, and he loved to indulge in recalling the doings of local musical societies with which he was conversant.\r\nFor forty years Mr Daniel was a member of the congregation at Highbury Chapel and during the great part of that period had been deacon. Organisations associated with the Congregationalists enlisted his sympathies, and he amply justified the soundness of the aphorism that if any work was required to be done, get a business man to do it. He served on the committee of the Western College, and of the Gloucestershire and Herefordshire Congregational Union, of which he was a past president. For half-a-century he had been one of the honorary secretaries of the Bristol Young Men's Christian Association, while he was a past president of the Bristol City Mission and chairman of the Executive Committee.\r\nBesides much labour in comparatively unobtrusive channels, Mr Daniel in 1894 was appointed Justice of the Peace for the city, and at the advanced age of 68 years he was chosen Sheriff of Bristol.",

He has filled three highly responsible charges in the old United See, one of them under circumstances of quite exceptional difficulty. Of his work at St. Stephen's there is no need for me to speak at length; the unfeigned sorrow of the very many who were wont to resort thither bears its emphatic testimony, and when after long battling with great weakness, and alas! great suffering, he decided to lay down his charge, he assuredly set a seal to his fruitful labours which all must recognise and respect.'",

Mr Norris, who was born at Bristol on the 15th of October, 1842, was the son of Mr Robert Norris, and Mrs Catherine Norris, his mother, was a daughter of the late Mr John Freeman Saunders. He received his education at private schools, and at University College London. He was called to the bar, and joined the Western Circuit in 1865, and in 1867 he married a daughter of the late Major-General Woodburn, C.B. For many years Mr Norris was a prominent figure in the life of Bristol. His career at the Bar was very successful, and his abilities as a pleader were such that his services were requisitioned in various parts of the country as well as on the particular circuit with which he was associated. In politics he was a staunch Liberal, and he was frequently to be found upon the platform of the Old Colston Hall advocating Liberal principles. Besides being an effective speaker he kept a watchful eye for any who attempted to interrupt the proceedings at these meetings, and if there was anything approaching disorder he quickly left the platform for the purpose of restoring quiet. He was president of the Anchor Society in 1872, and ensured the highest collection for many years with the exception of Mr Lewis Fry. He contested Wilton in the Liberal interest in 1877, but was unsuccessful, and he was again unsuccessful at Portsmouth in 1880. On the retirement of Sir W. H.

25/06/1912,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Robert Hall Warren,"DEATH OF MR ROBERT HALL WARREN\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death of Mr Robert Hall Warren, which occurred yesterday, in his 80th year, at his residence, 9 Apsley Road, Clifton. Mr Hall Warren was widely known in Bristol, for he had been associated with it throughout his long life, and was the grandson of a noted preacher, the Rev. Robert Hall, who was at one time the minister at Broadmead Baptist Chapel, coming from Leicester to Bristol. In 1848 Mr Hall Warren became associated with his father's business, that of Messrs Leonard, Warren, and Co., iron merchants, of Bridge Street, and later he became a partner with Mr James Godwin, as Messrs Godwin, Warren, and Co., in Redcliff Street. The deceased gentleman  married in 1865 Mary, second daughter of Mr Isaac Leonard, a surgeon in Bristol, and in 1887 he retired from business but he did not cut himself off entirely from city life, for he became a director of the Bristol and South Wales Railway Wagon Company, a position which he occupied until the present time. His interests covered a wide range, and he was associated with various institutions in the city. As a member of the committee of the Bristol Royal Infirmary for over 20 years he took a keen interest in that institution, and rendered invaluable aid in its management, acting at one time as the President for some months during a period when the presidency was in transition. He was a member of the committee of the Convalescent Home, first as a representative of the Infirmary and then as a representative of the city. Mr Hall Warren's interest in the world of art extended over a long period. He succeeded the late Mr D. C. A. Cave as the hon. secretary of the Bristol Fine Arts Academy, in Queen's Road, and when he resigned that position he was succeeded by Mr R. C. Tuckett. An antiquarian of considerable renown, Mr Hall Warren was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquarians, and, locally, he filled the office of secretary and treasurer of the Clifton Antiquarian Club, in the proceedings of which he took an active part, amongst the papers he read before the members being a notable one on Medieval Chapels. As a member Mr Hall Warren attended most of the meetings of the Gloucestershire Archaeological Society, and was able to contribute valuable information upon various matters. Singularly well acquainted with the history of the city and the lives of its famous men, Mr Hall Warren was frequently consulted upon matters relating thereto, and his knowledge of the Cathedral led to his being a valuable lay consultant and worker in connection with its restoration. By his advice much of the material of demolished parts of the fabric was incorporated in the restoration, parts of which he personally superintended. The sedilia was a particularly precious specimen of his wonderful knowledge and skill, and in fact up to the present time he was frequently attending to one matter or another at the Cathedral. Mr Hall Warren was a personal friend of the Bishop, the Dean, and the members of the Chapter, and they expressed their recognition of his valuable services by placing a resolution on their minutes indicative of their appreciation. As recently as last Sunday morning Mr Hall Warren attended Divine Service at the Cathedral, when the tribute was paid by the Bishop to the late Archdeacon Robeson.

24/11/1914,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Lady Emily Francis Smyth,"DEATH OF LADY SMYTH\r\n\r\nWe deeply regret to record the death of Lady Smyth, who succumbed to an attack of pneumonia in London at five o'clock last evening.\r\nLady Emily Francis Smyth was the daughter of the Rev. Henry Hugh Way, of Alderbourne Manor, Gerrard's Cross, Bucks (formerly of Henbury, Gloucestershire). She first became the wife of Captain George Oldham Edwards, of Redland Court, which Mr Stone, the leader of the Quarter Session Bar, once in a trail at the Guildhall described as the most attractive mansion in Bristol. After the death of Captain Edwards, his widow became the wife of Sir J. H. Greville Smyth, Bart., of Ashton Court, and Heath House, Stapleton, the marriage taking place in April 1884, at St. George's, Hanover Square, by special licence. There was an unusually large attendance of friends of the bride and bridegroom. The bridegroom's best man was Major William Verney, and the officiating clergy were the Bishop of Bath and Wells, and the Rev Hugh Failoon, vicar of Long Ashton. There were many tokens of rejoicing, upwards of 300 tenants being invited to dinner, and the workpeople on the estate having a treat.\r\nAt the tenants' dinner the Rev. J. H. Way, brother of Lady Smyth, responding to the health of his sister, said her one great object would be to make her husband care for Long Ashton Court and all around it, and she felt if she could induce him to take a real interest and pleasure in his house the marriage would not have been in vain. He was sure they were bent upon helping Lady Smyth in her new and important position in that neighbourhood and county. He believed she would do her best to fulfil her position, and if ever she made any mistakes he asked them to believe she had endeavoured to do her best for her husband, for Long Ashton Court, Ashton village, and for the neighbourhood.\r\nHow the gratifying expressions of the Rev. J. H. Way were manifested in the married life of Sir Greville and Lady Smyth, seventeen years of happiness proved. The baronet died in September, 1901, and with his death the baronetcy became extinct. After his marriage very little of his time was spent at Ashton Court, mainly owing to the illness of Lady Smyth, which necessitated their wintering abroad.\r\nAfter the death of Sir Greville, Lady Smyth interested herself greatly in matters which affected the inhabitants of Long Ashton and Bedminster. An addition to the open spaces of the city was provided by the presentation of the site of Dean Lane Colliery, five acres in extent, by Lady Smyth, which has been laid out as a children's playground, and is known as 'Dame Emily Playground'. The large hall formerly used for library purposes at the Bristol Museum was remodelled and completely fitted with museum cases by the generosity of Lady Smyth, who gave Â£2,000 for this purpose. In this room, known as the 'Greville Smyth' Room, are lodged the fine collections of insects numbering over 29,000 specimens which were collected by the late baronet and presented by Lady Smyth in 1902, together with all other invertebrates possessed by the museum. In February 1913 a further room, which had by another act of generosity on the part of Lady Smyth been fitted out as the 'Dame Emily Smyth' Room of Economic Biology and Botany, was opened by the donor.\r\nAlmhouses and a public hall at Long Ashton provided through the generosity of Lady Smyth have been duly appreciated. At Ashton Court are several objects which possess a charm for those of an antiquarian turn, and archaeologists were ever welcome to examine the valuable stores. When the Somerset Society made an incursion into the northern part of their county they were invited by Lady Smyth to inspect the records of the past at the Court, and the visit was highly enjoyed by the members and their friends.\r\nLady Smyth was a generous supporter of the Bristol General Hospital, and of many other institutions of a philanthropic character in Bristol. She also contributed liberally to the Church Extension movement. No appeal for a deserving cause was made in vain, and the death of her Lady will be a great loss to the city and neighbourhood.",

The deceased was the head of the firm of Messrs E. T. Collins and Son, chartered accountants, Baldwin Street and one of the representatives of Redland Ward at the City Council. Mr Collins had not been in the best of health for some time, and had been attended by Dr Shingleton Smith. A week ago he had a paralytic seizure, and, never regaining consciousness, he passed away at a quarter to seven yesterday morning. He had been in business between 30 and 40 years, and occupied offices in Broad Street for a number of years before going to the Baldwin Street premises. Prior to that time he was a partner in the firm of Messrs Hudson, Smith, Williams, and Co., of the Stock Exchange.\r\nMr Collins was for many years associated with the trade of the city through being secretary of the Bristol and West of England Merchants' Association whose headquarters were at his office in Broad Street. He thus was largely confined to the management of insolvent estates in the West of England and South Wales, and became an authority in respect to bankruptcy business. After his removal to Baldwin Street, Mr Collins was in partnership with his son at the Scottish Widows' Fund Buildings, and was able to find greater scope for his profession as a chartered accountant. He was connected with the Bristol Benevolent Institution, and for some time acted as secretary, though of late years his son, Mr Arthur Collins, who was his partner in the profession of accountant, became joint secretary with him. At the recent annual meeting regret was expressed at the absence of Mr E. T. Collins through ill-health.

He was the father of the Jerusalem Lodge, of which he was Master in 1886, and in 1890 he held the office of Provincial Grand Junior Warden. He was one of the founders of the St. Stephen Lodge, and has acted as steward for the Province on the Masonic Charities. He attained high rank also in Royal Arch and Mark Masonry. He was first Principal in the Beaufort Chapter in 1894, and afterwards held office in the Provincial Grand Chapter. He was Master of the Baldwyn Mark Lodge in 1895, and was Senior Grand Warden in Provincial Mark Lodge last year. In the Knight Templar Degree he held the distinguished position of Provincial Prior of Bristol and Gloucestershire, and was also Inspector General of the District of Baldwyn in which positions he succeeded the late Bro. William Proctor not many months ago.\r\nThe deceased leaves a widow and five children, all of whom are married.",
17/03/1914,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Francis Fox,"THE LATE MR FRANCIS FOX, M. INST. C.E.\r\n\r\nMany readers doubtless noticed in our issue of yesterday the announcement of the death at Roden, Teignmouth, of Mr Francis Fox, M. Inst. C.E. The deceased gentleman died at the age of 95, and his longevity has undoubtedly made some of the later generation forget the responsible professional work in which he was formerly engaged. Nearly sixty years have elapsed since he was appointed Chief Engineer to the Bristol and Exeter Railway; he was concerned in the important development connected with that undertaking, and has earned a place in local history owing to the part he played in planning the present Joint Station at Temple Meads, and also as the engineer consulted when the inconvenient old Drawbridge was removed and St. Augustine's fixed bridge constructed.\r\nThe connection of Mr Fox with the Bristol and Exeter Railway carries the thoughts back to a period when means for travelling were very different from those now enjoyed, yet at quite an early period the line to the West, for which he became Engineer, achieved notable records in quick running with its broad-gauge trains. The company had important locomotive works in Bristol, and shared in the scheme of which the Harbour Railway was the outcome, a link being made with the older lines by a tunnel under Redcliff Hill. Although in its day the Bristol and Exeter Railway was of no small importance in its relation to the travelling facilities between Bristol and the West, its station at Temple Meads was practically devoid of architectural pretensions. Brunel was not sufficiently impressed by the idea that there would be through traffic, and the arrangements of the several companies at this important centre were, from the modern point of view, very inconvenient. Bristol station in 1870 was described as 'the most disgraceful, dangerous, difficult, and impracticable in Europe', and this statement was made at a meeting of the Great Western Company at a time when joint action was being considered for mitigating the great difficulties that existed.\r\nMr Francis Fox had a considerable share in the enterprise which gave Bristol the new Joint Station, but it has been stated in answer to critics that, in the opinion of Mr Fox himself, the long delay in putting his plans into operation made the accommodation in some respects seem out of date before it was available for public use. The down platform was opened for passengers on July 6th, 1874, and the entire station, costing nearly Â£300,000, was completed shortly afterwards. The constructional work had to be executed without interfering with the traffic. In the following year it was announced that the 'Bristol and Exeter' was to be absorbed by the Great Western Company, and this amalgamation took place in 1876. The mere mention of these momentous departures suggests that the term during which Mr Fox was Chief Engineer to the Bristol and Exeter line was an eventful one. Not only the station buildings, but the divisional offices also, are the outcome of his designs, and from the up incline passers-by can see his monogram carved high up on the front of the buildings. The Cheddar Valley line was among the branches constructed while he was Chief Engineer, and on the Bristol and Exeter passing under the care of the Great Western Board, Mr Fox became a member of the staff of the controlling company. The station at Weston-super-Mare was built under his superintendence.\r\nIn 1866, when building lots in Leigh Woods were advertised, Mr Francis Fox became a pioneer in that now considerable residential district. Having secured a site from the Leigh Woods Land Company, he erected 'Glenside'. After residing there a few years, he came to the conclusion that a chalet of the Swiss type would harmonize with the surroundings, and erected the residence near the Suspension Bridge named 'Alpenfels'. He resided in Leigh Woods for twenty-seven years, and when Mr G. A. Wills generously intervened and secured for the public use Nightingale Valley and the remaining unoccupied land, Mr Fox contributed a couple of articles to the 'Western Daily Press' on reminiscences of the Woods and changes in forty years. This was preceded and followed by other charity contributions from his pen, and occasionally his ideas found expression in verse.\r\nMr Fox was a man whose enthusiasm stood the test of advanced age. He was a keen politician, and a warm supporter of the programme of the present Liberal Government.",

The deceased gentleman had been unable to take an active part in his business as solicitor since July, owing to heart disease, which was the cause of death.

He was admitted as a solicitor in 1850, and was appointed Registrar of the Tolzey Court (of which he was also deputy judge) in 1860. Mr Wansey, by taste and temperament, refrained from taking an active part in public and municipal life, and evoked himself with assiduity to the duties of the profession to which he belonged.

19/06/1900,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr John Harvey,"DEATH OF MR JOHN HARVEY\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death of Alderman John Harvey, which took place yesterday morning at his residence, Leigh Woods, after a lengthened illness. The deceased gentleman, though of a retiring disposition, will be much missed in local circles, as he was connected with many undertakings of a public character. He was the oldest son of the late Mr John Harvey, senior of the firm of Harvey and White, wine merchants, Denmark Street, Bristol, and at present carried on as John Harvey and Sons, Limited. He was born at Kidderminster on September 15th, 1832, so that he was 68 years of age. He was instructed privately, and received a sound commercial education, since his father intended him to take part in the Denmark Street establishment. In December, 1846, he entered the counting-house, and afterwards his brothers, Mr E. A. Harvey and Mr C. O. Harvey, also became initiated into the business, which is one of those large and important concerns that have done so much to enhance the commercial reputation of Bristol. To those who visit the establishment for the first time, it is a perfect revelation to discover the extent of the cellarage where, among other valuable stocks, he might have pointed out a consignment intended for St. James's Palace, for her majesty is among the customers of the firm. The exterior of the building, as seen from Denmark Street, is by no means imposing, though the interior contains many features of interest to an antiquary, and not many years ago a remarkably fine fire place in one of the rooms was revealed in the course of some structural alterations. Amidst these interesting surroundings the deceased became acquainted with the various branches of a wine merchant's business. Not that he gave his attention solely to the pursuits of trade, though his position as chairman of Harvey and Sons, Limited, rendered it necessary that he should devote considerable time to commerce. As his father lived to an advanced age he was long known as Mr John Harvey, jun., and he was thus described when, in 1875, he became president of the Grateful Society, his collection, Â£908, being the largest obtained in any one year\r\ntowards the funds of the society, with the exception of that made by Mr J. C. Wall, exactly 10 years previous (Â£941), since the record amount (Â£1,144) which Sir John Kerle Haberfield received in 1840. Mr Harvey was elected alderman in 1877, and became High Sheriff 1884-5. Though willing to render what service he could to\r\nthe city, the state of his health prevented his consenting to allow himself to be nominated for the mayoralty. He became member of the Municipal Charity Trustees in 1875, being one of the four Conservatives chosen that year; the others were Mr H. N. Abbot, Ald. F. F. Fox, and Mr A. F. Woodward. Perhaps no institution was more dear to the deceased gentleman than the Royal West of England Sanatorium, of which he was appointed president in 1890- 91-92. The structure forming a prominent object at Weston-super- Mare on the road to Uphill,found in him a large-hearted supporter, and he showed his interest in its welfare by his exertions when any prominent event in connection with the Sanatorium, such as the opening of the chapel, took place. The Industrial Home, at Knowle, was another institution that found in Mr Harvey a patron, and in 1891 his Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh honoured him by accepting his invitation to conduct Mr George Riseley's band at a concert held in the Colston Hall for the benefit of that home, and at its close Mr Harvey entertained the Duke of Beaufort, and others at the Colston Hall. The Mayor and Corporation of Bristol afterwards presented his Royal Highness with the freedom of the city, this being the only occasion during the present reign on which a member of the Royal Family has passed a night in night. Music and its surroundings seemed to possess an especial attraction for Mr Harvey; he not only gave valuable support to the triennial festivals in the city, but also for some years acted as local honorary secretary in the movement by which the associated boards of the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music conduct examinations. When the certificates were forwarded from headquarters he convened a gathering, which the Society of Merchants allowed to be held in their hall, in order to distribute the awards to the many young persons of the Bristol centre who were assembled to receive them. The present Dean of Chicester (the Very Rev. R. W. Randall) found in Mr Harvey, who was a staunch churchman, a valuable supporter at the Church of All Saints, Pembroke Road. When the Church of St. Mary, Leigh Woods, was projected, Mr Harvey, as a resident in that romantic locality, naturally assisted in the erection. He used to read the lessons at the services, and his daughter's marriage was the first celebration in the church.",

S. Wright, and inasmuch as his duties bought him into close contact with men of such eminence and influence, his position was of considerable service to him in making a good start at the bar. For some ten years prior to his appointment as a County Court judge, Mr Austin enjoyed an excellent practice, both in London and on the Western Circuit. He was particularly successful at the Bristol Assize, and it was not as a stranger, therefore, that he entered the gates of the city in which he now administers the law of the land. Mr Austin was not a barrister whose name was known to the public. As the sweetest flowers blossom in the shade so the best lawyers at the bar are often untouched by the glowing rays of publicity. Their work lies away from the vulgar path of sensationalism wherein the public like to tred. It was as a thoroughly capable lawyer, and not as an advocate with a tongue to sway the hearts of jurymen, that Judge Austin made his mark at the bar, and it was as a commercial lawyer perhaps, that he was chiefly known in the circles where the proper measure of a barrister is always taken. For in the Temple Mr Austin was extremely well known and highly respected. His courtesy and geniality made him numerous friends, some of whom counted it one of their best privileges in the Temple to smoke a pipe with him in his comfortable chamber in Paper Buildings. The manner in which his Honour has discharged his judicial duties has entirely justified his promotion. His popularity in Bristol affords an ample testimonial to his powers as a judge and his qualities as a man. He disposes of the cases brought before him with a rapidity which delights the litigants and practitioners in his court; the soundness of his decisions is unquestionable, and the courtesy with which he treats lawyers and lay men alike adds to the dignity of his office, and increases respect for the law'.\r\nAt the time that interesting appreciation was published in the legal journal, Mr Austin had not long presided over the Bristol County Court. A vacancy had arisen owing to the death of Mr Metcalfe, Q.C., and Lord Herschell selected Mr Austin for the post. He was the first County Court judge appointed by this Lord Chancellor who was (according to the 'Law Gazette') 'cordially congratulated at the time upon the excellent beginning he had made. That the appointment was not a political one was as clear as crystal, because Mr Austin's political views were not in harmony with Lord Herschell's. All his life he had been a Conservative; but he had never taken an active part in the political world. He was content to record his vote according to his conscience, whenever it was required of him, and to devote his time and energy to his practice'. The good impression formed early in his judicial career has been amply justified by fuller experience. For about 21 years his Honour has occupied this onerous position, and has on the appointed days sat also in the courts at Weston-super-Mare, Wells, and Axbridge, and there can be no questioning the fact that he was a good judge. Sir Thomas Bucknill is stated to have regarded him as the finest County Court judge in the country, and those who came before him were warm in their tributes. His decisions on points of law were not often appealed against, and were generally upheld when this occurred. With a knowledge of the law, he combined patience, good temper, sound common sense, and strong human sympathy. There are few position which enable a public man to see more of human nature than that of County Court Judge. The judgement summonses of a single week would reveal to a novice much with regard to members of the community to whom appeals of creditors, legal processes, and the avoidance of 'imprisonment for debt' (or more correctly for disobeying the order of the Court) are part of the routine of daily life. It is important to realise the distinction drawn in this sentence because it imposes much responsibility upon a County Court judge.He has to decide whether non-payment is due to misfortune or wilfulness, whether in fact there is such ability to meet at least an instalment of the liability that failure to do so merits detention for several weeks in one of His Majesty's prisons. Judge Austin had certain unwritten rules for his own guidance in these matters, and his humanitarian spirit, coupled with his experience of debtors and litigants, has been of enormous value in the large class of cases that merely find publicity in a newspaper, and that are in the ordinary course of the Court's business disposed of with a rapidity astonishing - almost bewildering - to a visitor unused to the procedure.\r\nJudge Austin was also a Justice of the Peace for Bristol and for Somerset. His judicial qualities and the confidence he won from men in business and industrial circles led to his services being widely utilised in other directions. He had for many years acted as arbitrator to the Board of Trade in Labour and other disputes, and was one of the chairmen's panel in the Courts of Conciliation arranged by the Board of Trade. He ranked as an independent chairman of the Conciliation Boards connected with many great railway undertakings viz. the Great Western, the London and South Western, the Great Northern, and Metropolitan District Railway, the Somerset and Dorset, the Taff Vale, the Rhymney, and Cardiff Railway, and the Port Talbot Railway and Dock. He was joint arbitrator in the North Somerset coalfield under the Minimum Wages Board and chairman of the Advisory Committee for the South West of England for the purpose of Labour Exchanges. These many duties at times involved detailed and difficult investigations in the process of arriving at a settlement of an industrial difference, and Judge Austin will be missed in this important sphere as well as in that which brought him more prominently in view of the public.\r\nHe held aloof from political associations and on the only occasion when he accepted the presidency of a Colston Society it was that of the Grateful organisation in 1897-1898. He had on a number of occasions, however, expressed his views on social problems in addresses to Men's Brotherhoods and elsewhere.\r\nJudge Austin as most people know was a great lover of animals, dogs in particular. His sympathies went out unreservedly to the poor canine waifs of the city, and for many years past Mr Edward T. Parker has found in him a staunch supporter of the institution established more than 25 years ago for lost and starving dogs. Again and again Judge Austin has pleaded eloquently for this good work and his loss will be a severe blow to the institution. Judge Austin loved the companionship of old and faithful canine friends. Rarely in his walks was he unaccompanied by a dog. For many years a spaniel was his constant companion, and a story is told of t is old dog which we give with no attempt at explanation. Some while after the dog had died Judge Austin visited a house at Clifton. For a while he sat talking to the lady of the house. After his departure a visitor inquired who the gentleman with the dog was. 'Judge Austin, but he did not have a dog with him,' was the reply. 'But he had,' was the rejoinder,' it was a spaniel,' and the lady, who was a visitor to the house from Scotland, and had never previously met Judge Austin proceeded to describe in detail the old spaniel which had died and had been buried some time previously. The story was told by Mr Roger Austin on the authority of his father at a public dinner in Bristol. Judge Austin although not personally interested in prize dogs, was a regular visitor to shows held in Bristol, and in the course of a speech at a gathering of the Bristol and West of England Bull Dog Club he greatly encouraged the members by his advocacy of the hobby. He was chairman and treasurer of the Clifton Zoological Gardens Society.\r\nJudge Austin was one of those selected by the Bristol University for the Hon. I.L.D. degree, and he was a member of the Court of that institution. Few who were present at that momentous meeting held on November 14th, 1913, will readily forget the speech in which, dealing with the matter as an impartial outsider, he surveyed the situation which had given rise to such an acrimonious controversy. It was a masterly address, eminently judicial in tone, and it was felt that it did much to clear the air and influence the decision then arrived at. He was interested in sport, although not a very active participant. He used to enjoy a little shooting; cyclists formerly met him taking exercise on his 'wheel', and more recently he had found recreation as a member of the Henbury Golf Club.\r\nSympathy was felt when, about Christmas, it was heard that his Honour had been laid aside. His illness proved to be serious, and Mr Beresford was appointed to act as his deputy in the County Court. On Monday it was reported that his condition was critical and Mr Austin passed away at 9.30 yesterday morning at his residence 5, Worcester Road, Clifton, in his 64th year. He left a widow, three sons, and a daughter - Mr Roger Austin, high bailiff of the Bristol County Court; Mr L. J. Austin, F.R.C.S., attached to the London Hospital; Miss Austin; and Mr A. C. Austin, an engineer occupying a professional position in India.",

The deceased gentleman had been in good health up to Sunday last, on the morning of which day he attended Divine service at Emmanuel Church, where he had been rector's warden for six years. Later in the day Mr Rudman complained of being unwell, and Dr Shingleton Smith and Mr Harsant were called in. His condition became worse, and yesterday morning his condition was so critical that Dr Bertram Rogers and Dr J. Swain were called in. An operation was performed by Mr Harsant and though the deceased rallied for a time he subsequently had a relapse, and died soon after three o'clock. Deceased was 49 years of age, and the cause of death was peritonitis. He was head of the firm of Messrs James Rudman, of the oil and colour works at Frome Bridge, St. Philip's. Deceased, who would shortly have celebrated his silver wedding, leaves four children (three sons and a daughter), the eldest son having recently been associated with his father in the business. For a number of years deceased was connected with the 38th (2nd Gloucestershire) Volunteer Battalion R.E., entering the regiment with a commission about 18 years ago, almost immediately afterwards being promoted captain.

He was a member of the executive committee of the Engineers, and was one of the first from this district to attend the Engineering School at Chatham. He was a member of the Liberal club, and also of the present club committee. Whilst vicar's warden at Emmanuel, the deceased took great interest in the work associated with the building of  the new parish room. He was a member of the Anchor Society, and at the last election was asked to become a candidate for municipal honours; pressure of business and ill health necessitated a refusal, but it was understood that at a future election he would become a candidate. Deceased, who belonged to a Bristol family, married a daughter of Capt. Rider, and at the time of his death he was president of the Bristol Commercial Rooms, of which he had been for a long time member. Mr Rudman was a member of the council of the Bristol Chamber of Commerce from the year 1884 to 1892, when he took a very active part in the proceedings of the Chamber, and from the period of his election down to this last year he annually contributed the valuable trade reviews upon oils and petroleum, which appeared in the Chamber's reports from year to year.",

20/01/1897,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr James Bolton,"We regret to announce the death of Mr James Bolton, which took place yesterday morning at his residence, Charlotte Street, Park Street. Mr Bolton, who was 74 years of age, was born in London, and his career has been of a remarkably varied description. Coming to Bristol in the year 1843, he started business at the top of Park Street, in the manufactory of mineral waters, in connection with which he achieved great success. He then obtained the Hotwell House which at that time had lost much of its previous popularity. He added a swimming bath to the attractions of that house, and succeeded in making it a pleasant resort in Bristol. It was found necessary to remove the Hotwell House for the improvement of the river, and Mr Bolton's energies next found an outlet in Ceylon, where he became manager of the Hultsdorf Mills Company, a large cocoa-nut fibre manufactory. His success in connection with this enterprise was very marked, and when the business was transferred his efforts were recognised by the presentation of a silver service. Returning to Bristol he assumed the management of a large sugar refinery in Castle Street, which he developed in an extraordinary manner. This branch of the business, however, did not retain Mr Bolton's services permanently, and he subsequently went to Swansea, and became the head of a large iron foundry. In later years it will be remembered that Mr Bolton turned his attention to the fine arts, and opened a business in Park Street, from which he quite recently retired. He always took a great interest in the affairs of Bristol, and was at one time a director of the Royal Hotel Company, College Green, where he initiated some valuable improvements, including a laundry, which is one of the most successful features of the establishment. He also took a great interest in the Suspension Bridge, and was one of the first to cross before the structure was absolutely safe; in fact the feat formed at the time a subject of considerable comment. Two or three months ago letters appeared in this journal from Mr Bolton directing attention to the part which he had played about a quarter of a century before in suggesting to the Great Western Railway the desirability of reducing the second-class fares, a proposal the company a short time ago gave effect. As a traveller Mr Bolton had seen a good many parts of the world, having visited America, Italy, the Mediterranean etc., and was exceedingly fond of travel as a recreation.

27/11/1911,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Francis Tagart,"DEATH OF MR FRANCIS TAGART\r\n\r\nDeath has been busy of late amongst notable men in the city and neighbourhood of Bristol, and to-day we have to record, with deep regret, the decease of Mr Francis Tagart, J.P., which took place on Saturday, at his residence, Old Sneed Park, Stoke Bishop. Mr Tagart was not a native of Bristol, but he had resided at Old Sneed for more than half a century, and by his geniality and kindliness of nature he endeared himself to all with whom he came into contact.\r\nMr Francis Tagart was born on December 1st, 1817, and had therefore nearly completed his 94th year. He was very active for his age, and within the past few weeks he was in Bristol attending a meeting called by the Lord Mayor at the Council House. He was the son of Mr William Tagart, by Amy, eldest daughter of Nicholas Lethy. He married in 1848 Miss Isabella Firmin Ougley, youngest daughter of Captain Ougley, born in 1852, who married in 1875 Miss Emily, the youngest daughter of Mr James Rayner, and who died in 1904. Mr Tagart was formerly a London merchant, and his business brought him into contact with many commercial men resident in other countries. In the course of his long life he travelled extensively, and was much in the United States, which were very different in some respects, when he first became acquainted with American life, to what they are at the present day. He saw several large towns develop and some important towns have their commencement. He went to the spot which became the city of Chicago prior to the first city being built, so that he could speak of it before it was rebuilt after the devastating fire which reduced the original to ruins. He was a Fellow of the Linnean Society as well as a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society.\r\nAlways ready to promote any scheme for the furtherance of Bristol trade, Mr Tagart became one of the promoters of Avonmouth Dock, and regarded with satisfaction its development and subsequent purchase by the Bristol Corporation. An undertaking in which he was largely interested was the Grand Junction Water Company, of which he was director until the Government converted the control into a trust. He was also connected with the Surrey Dock Company, having been thrice chosen chairman of the board. Mr Tagart was a lieutenant for the City of London. He was one of the oldest members of the Reform Club, and his residence in the metropolis was at Queen's Gate. In politics he was an active Liberal, and on one occasion meditated becoming a candidate for a seat in Parliament. In the early 'sixties of the last century he, in company with Mr E. A. Freeman, the historian, came forward for East Somerset, which was represented by Sir William Miles and Mr Knatchbull. His colleague had made two efforts to represent other constituencies, though with no effect. In 1857 he came forward at Cardiff, and in 1859 at Wallingford, but on both occasions was too late in the field, and retired without going to the poll. With Mr Tagart Mr Freeman addressed meetings in Somerset, but neither of them proceeded with the contest.\r\nAs a magistrate for the county of Gloucester Mr Tagart was very attentive to his duties at Lawford's Gate Petty Sessions, so that his figure on the Bench became one of the most familiar of any justice of the division. His liberality was considerable, and his invariable practice when winter approached was to forward to Messrs Latcham and Montague (the clerks) a cheque for the poor box. Although not so energetic in commercial matters towards the close of his career as in former years, he remained in touch with business undertakings. He lost no opportunity of stating that his business connections were entirely in London, and not in Bristol. When the scheme was propounded for extending the boundaries of this city so that Stoke Bishop should be included in the limits of Bristol, he was an energetic opponent, and attended the Committee Room at Westminster to protest against becoming a Bristol citizen. He said that his associations were with London and he had nothing to do with Bristol. He was delighted with the visit of the members of the Associated Chambers of Commerce to our city to hold their Congress, in July, 1906, and entertained them at a garden party at Old Sneed Park. Many persons will have pleasant recollections of the opportunities afforded them of inspecting his beautiful grounds, which, when they looked their loveliest, were thrown open to the public. He occasionally allowed the use of his grounds for the Exhibitions of the West Gloucestershire Farmers' Club, and he treated the Bristol telegraph boys there. Mr Tagart was well known as a sportsman, and for many years he hunted regularly with the Duke of Beaufort's hounds as well as with Lord Fitzhardinge's pack.\r\nHe took a keen interest in matters connected with the locality in which he resided. Some years ago he was a prominent figure at the inauguration of a drinking fountain in the neighbourhood, when a presentation was made to Canon Alford upon his resigning the position of vicar of St. Mary Magadalene, Stoke Bishop, after an association of 15 years with the parish, Mr Tagart presiding over the gathering at the Village Hall. In the course of his opening speech, he said that personally he could make the confession that in a time of great trial and tribulation he had found their vicar a source of great comfort and consolation. It was with pleasure Mr Tagart, on behalf of the congregation, handed Canon Alford a cheque for Â£200 and a handsome silver tray, suitably inscribed.\r\nSome readers may recollect a period in which Mr Tagart figured in a movement in opposition to the late Mr James Inskip. In the year 1885 there was a contention locally respecting the performance of a Sunday band. The band played upon Durdham Down, and attracted a great many people, though by no means the 10,000 or 20,000 claimed in some of the correspondence which found its way into the newspapers. Mr Francis Tagart became the champion of the musicians, and published, 'A Plea for the Sunday Band'. This brought out a pamphlet by Mr Inskip under the title, 'Mr Tagart's Test Tested, written by Mr James Inskip'. The controversy waxed exceedingly warm, and in one or two instances pressure was attempted to be brought upon citizens who aided the musical movement, so that they were threatened with the loss of their situations in the event of continuing to give their support. Mr Tagart maintained that the public had a right, as the owners of Durdham Down, to have a band performance on Sundays if they chose, and the attempt to put down the band was an attempt to nullify an Act of Parliament. Mr Inskip rejoined that the legitimate purpose of bye-laws would be to prohibit the appropriation of civic property for Sunday amusement.\r\nMr Tagart was courteous and genial as he was active in respect to any movements in which he deeply sympathised, and he was as unaffected as he was popular, not merely among a large circle of personal friends, but also with the general public, who knew his liberality, and appreciated warmly his endeavours to promote the welfare of the masses. A proof of his generous nature was afforded in September, 1909, when the president of the Infirmary (Sir George White, Bart.) acknowledge the receipt of Â£1,000 from Mr Tagart towards defraying the debt of Â£3,500 upon that institution, in order to secure the Â£1,000 conditionally offered by Mr Samuel White to the committee.\r\nThe news of the death of Mr Tagart was received with deep regret at Westbury-on-Trym (writes our correspondent), especially among the members of the local Horticultural Society, of which he was the first and only president. Himself a member of the Linnean Society, the deceased gentleman took a deep interest in everything pertaining to horticulture, and from the inception of the local Flower Show, he also emphasized the desirability of offering special encouragement to those who exhibited in the cottages and allotments sections. His handsome subscription to the fund enabled the committee to offer very substantial prizes, and thus always secure a large number of entries. Until two years ago Mr Tagart almost invariably presided at the annual luncheon in connection with the society, and the mental and physical vigour he displayed on those occasions - even in his ninetieth year - was the admiration of all who were present. On the occasion of the last two shows, Sir Herbert Ashman took the place of the president at the luncheon, but Mr Tagart visited the show later in the afternoon, even in August last. At times of special importance too, Mr Tagart was a well-known figure in the Village Hall, and at various outdoor functions on behalf of charitable objects.",
20/07/1911,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Dr John Beddoe,"DEATH OF DR BEDDOE\r\n\r\nA DISTINGUISHED SCIENTIST\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MEMOIR\r\n\r\nWe regret to have to announce the death, which occurred yesterday at his residence, the Chantry, Bradford-on-Avon, of Dr Beddoe, whose attainments as a physician and scientist brought him into contact with the foremost men of the day.\r\nJohn Beddoe was born on September 21st, 1826, at Bewdley in Staffordshire. His ancestors rendered their names Beddoe or Beddoes indifferently, and he came of an old Shropshire yeoman stock. His father was engaged in various businesses, and the subject of this biography was the second of eight children. One of the remarkable things about him is that he lived to a vigorous old age. If in his youth he did not suffer from all the maladies that flesh is heir to, he, at least, had a far larger share than falls to the lot of the average mortal. He was delicate as a child: and when ten years old suffered from a very severe attack of continued fever - whether typhus or typhoid he could not tell; rheumatic fever, typhoid, and then dysentery attacked him in his schoolboy days, and later he developed lung and heart trouble. Yet this was the man who at 84 presented the appearance of vigorous old age and wrote with a cheeriness and almost an exuberance which many a young man might envy the recollections of a long and active life. He was a thoughtful lad, and sometimes astonished his seniors by his unexpected questions on unusual subjects.\r\n\r\nFROM LAW TO MEDICINE\r\n\r\nThere being an idea of his receiving training to fit him for a conveyancing barrister, he about 1845, entered a solicitor's office, but before he had gone very far in his legal work events occurred which diverted him from law to medicine. He had interested himself in physiological chemistry, and hit upon a method in advance of existing practice for estimating the relative value of nutriments. A Dr. Robertson, of Buxton, had recently published a book upon diet, and young Beddoe sent particulars of his plan to this physician. The recipient naturally supposed that the communication was from a medical confrere interested in the same subject that he had been investigating, and in a communication to the 'Lancet' referred to 'Dr Beddoe'. The family doctor brought the paper to Beddoe's house, and jokingly spoke of a rival to himself having come into the field. This led to the suggestion that the so-called rival should seriously devote himself to medicine and abandon the law. The recommendation was adopted, and new courses of study embarked upon. The B.A. degree was taken at London University, and there Mr Beddoe became the first M. B. The author of these successes, however, had determined to have two strings to his bow, and went to a clever Edinburgh coach, and got through not only the first examination of the University there, but won an essay prize. By good fortune he happened to find out the part of the anatomy on which he would be examined, and so crammed in the last hour, and received the examiner's congratulations! The M.D. soon followed, and during an excursion to Orkney about this time began that 'quest into hair and eye colour' which became a principal life hobby.\r\n\r\nASSOCIATIONS WITH LISTER\r\n\r\nDuring his residence in Scotland, Lister and Beddoe were chums, and the adventurous spirit of the latter nearly deprived the world of a man to whose antiseptic theories of surgery the world owes a greater debt than anyone can estimate. They were climbing together on the Salisbury crags at Edinburgh when the accident occurred, which happily did not end, but which easily might have ended a great life.\r\nJoining a civil hospital staff, Dr Beddoe had some experience in the Crimea, and spent a long holiday in Holland, Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Italy before settling down to wait for a practice as a physician in Clifton, which he did in the summer of 1857.\r\n\r\nSETTLEMENT AT CLIFTON\r\n\r\nIn his recollections published by Mr J. W. Arrowsmith, in the autumn of 1910, Dr. Beddoe refers to his settlement in Clifton. 'It was,' he said, 'an imprudent move, as the way was really very completely blocked. Dr. John Addington Symonds, father of the gifted author of that name, had the best practice of the kind out of London. He was a man of remarkable ability, character, and general accomplishments, and still in middle life. William Budd, a man of brilliant genius, and Brittan, also of fair ability, and two or three younger men were all in reality waiting for the reversion ... A vacancy occurred in the Bristol Infirmary immediately after my arrival, for which I became a candidate: but the result was a foregone conclusion. Dr Edward Long Fox, a young man with great local interest, but who had only just taken his degree, obtained the appointment. He was a man of fine nature and great industry and perseverance; and we became great friends though always rivals in practice. In after years we were for a considerable period the two leading physicians of Bristol; but he had always the larger clientele, though mine was at least as good in quality. A dispensary appointment furnished me with the opportunity of doing a considerable amount of gratuitous work, and this I retained until, in a few years, another vacancy occurred at the Infirmary. This time I had practically a walk-over.'\r\nMarrying Miss Agnes Montgomerie Christison in 1858, daughter of a Foulden, Berwickshire, minister, Dr Beddoe continued to increase his practice and his interests in Bristol, his wife being also actively associated with a variety of goods works, notably as a governor of the Bristol Endowed Schools, and as Miss Mary Carpenter's 'right hand in many matters'. The Infirmary appointment was kept for 11 years, and Dr Beddoe never neglected his opportunities for ethnological study. His records enabled him to publish a paper 'On the Supposed Increasing Prevalence of Dark Hair in England', which brought Charles Darwin into correspondence with him, and the celebrated writer on the origins of descent thanked Dr Beddoe for his information and for the kindness which prompted him to supply it.\r\nAs far back as 1849 he had paid a visit to Ireland, and between 1860 and 1874, while resident in Clifton, made four tours in that country, where archaeology and other subjects occupied him. He systematically pursued his anthropological work, and in 1885 had in the press a work on the 'Races of Britain'. At that date he took a voyage to Australia, where he spent a short term in travelling.\r\n\r\nREMOVAL TO BRADFORD-ON-AVON\r\n\r\nClifton continued to be his home until in 1891 he gave up practice, when he took up his residency at The Chantry, Bradford-on-Avon. The house had associations which appealed to him, it having belonged to Walsingham, the secretary of Queen Elizabeth, while in later days it was the birthplace of Sir John Cam Hobhouse, the friend and companion of Bryon. He had made many friends in Clifton, and upon his departure was entertained at two dinners, one, over which Dr Marshall presided, being attended by his medical brethren, while the other was held to indicate the respect felt for Dr Beddoe. Among other classes of citizens, the Right Hon. Lewis Fry presided at this gathering. An address was presented to him bearing the signatures of many influential people of this district, and from his medical friends he received the gift of a bronze casket containing their valedictory address.\r\nHis departure from Clifton and his cessation of the work of physician was prompted by ill health following influenza. Dr Beddoe felt at that period that his course was nearly run, but happily he surmounted the physical difficulty as he had done so many others during his life. In his 'Recollections', he alludes to the fact that his Bristol friends had shown they had not forgotten him, and for Bristol and its varied interests he felt a warm admiration. \r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC WORK\r\n\r\nHis scientific work was recognised by his being appointed President of the Anthropological Institute in 1889-90, and about this time his old University, Edinburgh, made him an Hon. LL.D. In 1890 he was Rhind Lecturer, and delivered at Edinburgh six lectures on the Anthropological History of Europe. In 1905 he was Huxley Lecturer to the Anthropological Institute, his theme being, 'Colour and Race in Europe'. Two years later his portrait was purchased by subscription and presented to the Bristol Municipal Art Gallery. While resident at Bradford the veteran physician served for some time on the Wilts County Council, and took a share in the Poor Law and Urban District Council work of his own neighbourhood. Bristol still preserved a link with him by making him President of its Archaeological Society, of the Kyrle Society, and by appointing him Hon. Professor of Anthropology of the University of Bristol.\r\nSome years ago, when the building in Park Street, now the Masonic Hall, was the Philosophical Institution, lectures were given during the winter months. Among those who read papers was Dr Beddoe, whose subjects were chiefly concerning ethnology. When a number of skulls were found in excavating for the foundations of the Gas Company's offices, they were produced at a meeting of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society. Dr Beddoe attended and gave some valuable suggestions.",
09/10/1911,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Alderman Charles Bowles Hare,"ALDERMAN C. B. HARE\r\n\r\nFATHER OF THE BRISTOL COUNCIL\r\n\r\nSUDDEN DEATH AT THE COLISEUM\r\n\r\nWidespread regret was caused on Saturday when it became known that Ald. Charles Bowles Hare had died suddenly while at the Bristol Coliseum. In the afternoon he visited the interesting exhibition being held there, and while looking down at something which caught his attention he dropped unconscious. Help was at once rendered, and he was lifted into the cottage hospital forming one of the exhibits. There it was discovered  that nothing further could be done; the long and useful career of a respected citizen had been impressively, in a moment, brought to an end.\r\nThe deceased gentleman was the eldest son of Charles Bowles Hare, of Clifton, and his wife, Henrietta, daughter of Henry Grace, of the county of Surrey. He was born at 9, Savile Place, Clifton, on June 6th, 1841, and educated at Cheltenham College. He became identified with the important Bristol industry carried on under the title of John Hare and Co., and at thirty made his entry into civic life, being returned to the City Council for Redcliff. That occurred in 1871, when the ward sent six members to a Corporation possessing no jurisdiction over the large suburban districts which had grown up outside the city. In the forty years of his service he saw vast changes. Councillors came and councillors went, some retiring from municipal activities, many being to another world. Mr Hare continued in his steady, consistent work until all his contemporaries had gone, and thus for a considerable period he has been honoured as the father of the Council, although few would have suspected from his appearance that he had attained this veteran rank. He was, of course, one of the old Conservative phalanx, but he was one who could work well with those who disagreed with his political views, and the esteem felt for him was not limited to one party. For a time he was leader of his party in the Municipal Chamber.\r\nDuring Ald. Hare's long municipal term the city was twice enlarged, and the membership of the Council increased, the old gilded chamber, where the Corporation assembled when he joined it, had been abandoned for a more spacious, but less ornate, meeting place, and in the numerous departments of municipal work very great changes have occurred. The modern dock equipment of Bristol is the result of Council decisions, arrived at after seemingly interminable controversy, during the period of Alderman Hare's service. Redcliff continued to return him until 1896, when he was made an alderman. Much of his attention was given to dock work, and in December 1908, the Docks Committee took the unusual course of recording its sense of his services. He had been one of the vice-chairman of that body, and had acted as chairman of an important sub-committee, but health considerations led him to ask relief from these special responsibilities. The resulting of the Docks Committee was as follows:-\r\n'That this committee desire to place on record their best thanks to Alderman Hare and appreciation of the valuable services which he has rendered for the last thirty-five years to the Docks Committee and citizens generally as a member of the committee, and for the last fifteen years as chairman of the Sub-Committee for Works and as one of the vice-chairmen of this committee, and at the same time to express their regret that he finds himself unable to continue his work in these latter positions'.\r\nIn his reply to this appreciation, Alderman Hare said he regretted that he had felt obliged to resign the chairmanship of the Works Sub-Committee, but he hoped to be able to continue to attend the meetings of the committee and sub-committees. This he has done. He was also a member of the Lord Mayor's Selection Committee, the Finance Committee, the Insurance Committee, and chairman of the Committee on Committees. When the late King Edward came to Bristol to open the Royal Edward Dock, Alderman C. B. Hare was one of the senior members of the Council selected for presentation to his Majesty.\r\nMembership of the Council occupied but little part of his energies. He became a member of the Society of Merchants in 1870, and attained the dignity of Master six years later. In 1878 he was chosen Sheriff, Sir George Edwards being at the time Mayor. He associated himself with the Colston Parent Society, and was at one time president and treasurer; he was for several years churchwarden of St. Mary Redcliff, and was in that position when the money was raised for restoring the tower and spire. His interest in education led to his becoming one of the managers for three important schools - Redcliff National, Temple Boys, and St. Silas' National. In various Church of England movements he showed an interest, and his musical tastes led to his being appointed deputy chairman of the Bristol Festival Committee in 1878 and 1893, while in 1896 he was acting chairman. He had acted as a director of George's Brewery Company, of the Bristol Water Company, the Clifton Suspension Bridge Company, and to the old Rifle Drill Hall Company. He has been a justice of the peace for Bristol since 1881, and therefore is one of the senior members of the magisterial body. He was an enthusiastic Volunteer, and was one of the first to join the Bristol Rifle Corps. He was enrolled on September 20th, 1859, and served until 1871, retiring with the rank of lieutenant. He still continued his connection with the corp as an honorary member. He has on many occasions figured in local Conservative movements, and in recent years his son, Mr Aubone Hare has shown that politically he is following in his father's footsteps. It will be realised from this biographical survey that the late alderman was one who touched public life at numerous points, and his decease at the age of 70 directs attention to the exceptional service he has rendered to his native city.",
11/08/1911,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Alderman William Robert Barker,"Widespread regret was felt in Bristol yesterday afternoon, when it became known the illness of Alderman W. R. Barker terminated fatally. Few men have more fully and consistently served the city of his adoption in public work, and for the last years he has devoted a considerable portion of his leisure to Poor Law and municipal administration. He has been lately laid aside, and it is some time since he has been able to attend a Council meeting. He passed away at his residence, 106, Redland Road, at the age of only a few weeks short of 78.\r\nWilliam Robert Barker was born in London but had resided for so many years in Bristol and so closely identified himself with the history and antiquities of the city that he came to be regarded by many persons as an expert. He early entered with much heartiness public work. Bristol then had its Poor Law administration conducted under three separate jurisdictions, and two of the Boards, before sharing responsibility for portions of the city, had to look after the poor of a group of villages. Mr Barker joined one of these bodies - Barton Regis Board of Guardians - which met each week at the workhouse at Eastville, and lived to see the city increase its boundaries enormously, while the whole municipal body was formed into one civil parish and the divided Poor Law control brought to an end.\r\nMr Barker entered the City Council in 1882 for Westbury Ward where he defeated the late Mr William Smith by eight votes. Boundary enlargement and changes due to the redistribution of seats have helped to develop the identity of the district he represented, the ward now bearing the name Westbury being then in the county. We may think of Barker's constituency as the important residential district of Redland. At the end of the first term Mr Barker found himself opposed by Mr George Pearson, afterwards one of Bristol's valued aldermen, and although the ward had strong Conservative indications, and Mr Barker was a Liberal, he secured a majority of 65 votes. At subsequent elections he was not troubled by opponents, and in 1902, when a couple of vacancies occurred in the aldermanic ranks, he was chosen to fill one of the gaps. He served on the Finance Committee, but was better known for his work in connection with public libraries and with the Museum and Art Gallery. Conditions within these institutions have undergone a transformation. Alderman Barker served on the civic Museum Committee which in course of time passed over the collection of books to the new Central Library in College Green, but through the generosity of Lord Winterstoke had added to its duties the care of a magnificent Art Gallery. As chairman of the Museum and Art Gallery Committee Alderman Barker had the satisfaction of seeing these associated institutions growing in popularity. Great changes have occurred in internal arrangements, and the display of treasures of one kind and another have undergone a vast improvement. Perhaps he was never more gratified than when the labours of himself and the civic office resulted in a new collection of pictures obtained from corporate bodies or individual lenders being arranged in that noble Art Gallery which owed its existence to the liberality of Lord Winterstoke. In Museum improvements he took the greatest pride.\r\nIn his story of the civic work which became his special interest, other features of his career have for the moment been omitted from their chronological place. In 1889 Alderman Barker was chosen a magistrate, and he was elected Mayor of Bristol 1892-93. A painful event took place in the Council Chamber during his Mayoralty. Sir Charles Wathen, who had been his predecessor in the civic chair, while sitting on one of the front benches at a Council gathering, was seized with a heart affection which expired in a few minutes. A subject which possessed considerable interest for Alderman Barker was the celebration of the fourth centenary of the discovery of North America by John Cabot, who sailed from the port of Bristol. The alderman, was appointed to represent the city at the meetings of the Royal Society of Canada, held in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1897.\r\nThe deceased Alderman showed much interest in window gardening and the Redland Flower Show was established mainly by his exertions. In the development of the Redland High School for Girls, of the council of which he was a member, he took an active part. During the damage caused by the serious floods in Bristol, he acted as honorary secretary of the Help Fund, towards raising and distributing money. When the party of Colonials visited Bristol he organised the reception, and taking the pen in hand, he prepared an attractive little handbook for the use of the visitors.\r\nAlderman Barker was, as might be noted, a man of culture, and a literary venture of considerable local importance emanated from this. It was 'St. Mark's or the Mayor's Chapel'. The elegantly got up volume, published by C. Hemmons, St. Stephen Street, with illustrations, 1892, was inscribed 'with great respect to Alderman Sir Charles Wathen, who for six years sustained the office of Mayor of Bristol and during whose mayoralty the restoration of St. Mark's Chapel was carried out'. Alderman Barker received assistance in his undertaking from the Town Clerk and the city treasurer and also from the city librarian. The Berkeley effigies in St. Mark's Chapel have been drawn by Mrs Bagnoll-Oakeley, and the lady consented to reproductions appearing in the volume. Ald. Barker divided his book into two parts, the first historical, dealing with the founder and the charters, and the history from 1720, which year commenced the period  when the Corporation had St. Mark's as their official place of worship. The restoration of 1888-9 was also dealt with; and the shabby neglected appearance before the restoration recalled. It may be that the existence of such a volume as that of Ald. Barker's will stop the recurrence of another period of indifference and decay.\r\nIn his fondness for archaeology he naturally admired the labours of Mr John Latimer, Bristol's latest historian, and in respect of his work on the charters of the city, published after his death, he stated, 'The writer has again rendered great service in the elucidation of our local history'.

05/01/1895,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr William Hathway,"THE LATE MR WILLIAM HATHWAY, J.P.\r\n\r\nYesterday morning, at the Bristol police court, special reference was made to the death of Mr William Hathway, J.P. The Mayor (Mr R. H. Symes) was in the chair, and the other magistrates present were Messrs A. Robinson, W. W. Jose, J. W. Arrowsmith and W.

Mr Hathway, he might remind them, was elected Mayor of Bristol in November 1872, and after that was elected an alderman, serving in that capacity for a good many years and giving good services to the citizens and Corporation in that capacity. Mr Hathway was also appointed a magistrate - and was a magistrate, of course, by virtue of his office of Mayor - and served on that bench with satisfaction and regularity. As all of them knew, Mr Hathway was a very old citizen, a very old business man, having been carrying on business for more than half a century very successfully. He was a gentleman who had lived all those years among them and never forfeited the respect of his fellow-citizens; they could all speak with great regard and great respect of him, and therefore the expression of regret would be unanimous at his death.",

05/09/1911,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Henry Overton Wills,"DEATH OF MR H. O. WILLS\r\n\r\nA MUNIFICENT BENEFACTOR\r\n\r\nIt is with much regret we announce the death of Mr Henry Overton Wills, the sad event occurring at his residence, Kelston Knoll, near Bath, on Sunday evening. The deceased gentleman was a member of a family renowned for their great liberality and public spirit, and he surpassed them all by his munificent gift which enabled Bristol to obtain the charter for her University. The eldest son of the late Mr Henry Overton Wills, J.P., of Bristol, he was born in this city on December 22nd 1828. He was educated at private schools, and then became associated with the firm of W. D. and H. O. Wills, the well-known tobacco manufacturers, whose place of business was then in Mary-le-Port Street. In course of time his cousin, Mr W. H. Wills, became the leading partner, and the deceased with his brothers, Mr Edward Payson Wills and Mr Frederick Wills, were the other partners. Mr H. O. Wills was a director of the Imperial Tobacco Company, although his health did not permit him to take an active part in the management in recent years. He was the father of Messrs George, Harry, and Melville Wills, who are directors of the company, and also of Mr Stanley Wills, who is a barrister.\r\n\r\nMr H. O. Wills became J.P. for the city and county of Bristol. He was a director of the Bristol Gas Company, the Bristol Wagon and Carriage Company, the Queen Insurance Company (local committee), the Bristol Athenaeum, and the Bristol Musical Festival Society. He was also a member of the Bristol Chamber of Commerce. He was on the Duke of Westminster's Executive Committee of the 'Queen's Nurses Jubilee Association', a member of the Bath Art Gallery Committee and the Bath Conservative Association, while he was vice-president of the Weston Conservative Association. He was not a member of the Bristol City Council, having been defeated in a contest with the late Mr J. C. Wall.\r\n\r\nLOVE OF THE ORGAN\r\n\r\nA great enthusiast of music, Mr H. O. Wills contributed towards two of the principal organs in the city. The erection of Colston Hall in 1867 proved an  incentive to Mr Philip John Smith to form the Philharmonic Society, and an organ was hired and placed upon the platform. It, however, proved inadequate, and some years later the directors of the hall decided to secure an organ of their own. Mr H. O. Wills, who was a director, in company with Mr George Riseley, who had been giving recitals on the original instrument, visited the Alexandra Palace, where a magnificent organ was tested. The result of the trial was so satisfactory that a specification for the Colston Hall organ was drawn up and entrusted to Mr Henry Willis, the builder of the instrument at the Alexandra Palace. Mr Riseley became organist to the Colston Hall Company, and Mr H. O. Wills took a special interest in the organ. Another instance in which Mr H. O. Wills was seen to display interest in an organ was when the Dean and Chapter were appealing for funds for a new organ at the Cathedral. Mr H. O. Wills generously intimated that they need be under no further financial difficulty, for he would take the responsibility upon himself. The organ was opened in October, 1907, and is a fine illustration of the ability of Mr Walker, the builder. Mr H. O. Wills possessed an excellent organ in his own residence, and he was an able amateur player. Pictures were a source of gratification to him, and he subscribed Â£1,000 to the Bath Victoria Art Gallery, besides presenting to the Bristol Municipal Art Gallery, erected through the liberality of his cousin, Lord Winterstoke, Herkomer's noble realistic painting, 'The Guards' Cheer'. Among the deceased's special acts of liberality must be mentioned Â£10,000 given towards the Bristol Convalescent Home, opened in connecting with Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee.\r\n\r\nTHE UNIVERSITY GIFT\r\n\r\nMr H. O. Wills will be remembered chiefly through his munificent gift to the University College. It was on January 14th, 1908, that Mr G. A. Wills (his eldest son), presiding at the University College Colston Society dinner, announced that his father had promised Â£100,000 towards the endowment of a University for Bristol and the West of England. The announcement, it need scarcely be said, met with an enthusiastic reception, and on July 9th following an address to King Edward on the subject of a charter for the University was presented when his Majesty visited Avonmouth for the purpose of opening the Royal Edward Dock. Following the offer of Mr H. O. Wills further promises of financial aid to the University scheme were forthcoming, and an official statement showed that nineteen donors had each contributed Â£1,000 or upwards. Members of the Wills family figured largely in the list, as will be seen from the following amounts contributed:- Mr H. O. Wills, Â£100,000; Lord Winterstoke, Â£35,000; Sir Frederick Wills, Â£10,000; Sir E. Channing Wills, Â£10,000; Mr G. A. Wills, Â£3,000; Mr H. H. Wills, Â£2,000; Mr W. Melville Wills, Â£1,000. In addition to his contribution Mr G. A. Wills presented to the University its athletic ground near Coombe Dingle.\r\n\r\nFREEDOM OF THE CITY\r\n\r\nIt seemed only natural that so large a donation towards the Bristol University as that given by Mr H. O. Wills should be acknowledged on behalf of the city in the most pronounced manner, and it was decided to confer upon him the freedom of the city. When proposing that the Freedom should be conferred upon Mr Wills, at the meeting of the City Council on the 14th September, 1909, the Lord Mayor (Mr Edward Robinson) said: A hundred thousand pounds is a very noble sum. It was given to a great cause, and I think it most fitting that we should acknowledge the interest and affection manifested by Mr H. O. Wills for the city in which he was born and bred by conferring on him the most cherished honour the city can bestow. Mr H. O. Wills has now reached the patriarchal age of four-score years, and owing to delicate health has lived retired for some length of time, but in his earlier years he was an active and valued participant in the commercial life of the city. Alderman Hare, who seconded the motion, remarked that if Mr Wills had not given such a large sum towards the University, they would not now have in their possession the Charter which marked an epoch in the history of Bristol. Alderman Hare referred also to the generosity of Mr Wills towards the medical charities. It was decided to confer the freedom of the city on Mr J. S. Fry as well as Mr H. O. Wills.\r\nThe presentation of the casket containing the certificate in connection with the freedom of the city in October, 1909, was shorn of much interest, as Mr H. O. Wills was at the time too unwell to leave his residence. The Lord Mayor, however, in the presence of his three sons, asked the eldest to receive the casket containing the certificate. Having received the casket, Mr Henry Herbert Wills expressed regret that his father was not well enough to be there, but also that he was absent through the inclement weather. Mr H. O. Wills had sent a telegram to the Lord Mayor in which he said: 'With deep regret I have to apologise to your lordship and the gentlemen of the Corporation for my inability, by reason of the severe weather, to leave my house and drive to Bristol and back to Bath on this memorable day, when I had naturally hoped to be at the Council House to receive the freedom of my native city; and to thank your lordship and the members of the Council for the distinguished honour conferred on me. I raise my glass to drink prosperity to the grand old city of Bristol and its Lord Mayor and Corporation, and say from my heart, 'Floreat Bristolia'.' Mr H. H. Wills (who on a subsequent occasion manifested his own liberality by presenting a valuable organ for Clifton College Chapel) read the following statement which his father had written. In it he said:-\r\n\r\nTo the Lord Mayor of Bristol and Gentlemen of the Council-,\r\nI thank you for the great honour which you have done me by summoning me to the Council Chamber of our city to receive at your heads the highest gift which I believe is in your power to bestow, namely, the freedom of the city of Bristol. It is a great thing for anyone to be thought worthy of this distinction, and no one can appreciate it too highly. Gentlemen, I am well aware of the reason why you have bestowed this honour upon one so unworthy of it as myself, and I am very glad to have helped forward the establishment of a University in our city and the West of England. Nor am I alone in this good work, for can we forget how Dr Percival pleaded for this when he came to found Clifton College, no how he has continued to desire a University for Bristol up to the present date? And we are all glad that the time has come when his desires have been accomplished. We must not forget how much we owe this happy result to the efforts of those gentlemen who have so devotedly supported the project by continuous labour and help; and amongst those I will name two, because I had the advantage of being at school with them in my young days. I refer to Mr Albert Fry and the Right Hon.

21/10/1911,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Walter J. Kidner,"DEATH OF MR WALTER J. KIDNER\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death of Mr Walter J. Kidner, the well-known Bristol musician, which occurred yesterday, after a long illness, at his residence, 8, Hampton Park, Redland.\r\nMr Kidner was a born musician, and during the whole of his career he was in touch with all kinds of movements in which music was largely concerned. Born in 1851, Mr Kidner had the advantage of a musical father, who became a member of one of his son's choirs, and who in his day played violin, trombone, and clarinet. At eight years of age Walter Kidner learned Tonic Sol fa in a class taught by Mr H. T. White. This class was at a chapel where his father led the music. He took the Intermediate Certificate from Mr White, and thus passed into the Tonic Sol fa Association, an  advanced choir conducted at that time by the late Alfred Stone. Losing his boy alto voice, Mr Kidner developed a remarkably good light tenor, and from the time of the settlement of his voice he was concerned in all Alfred Stone's choirs and glee parties. He sang the tenor solo music in 'Messiah' for the first time in 1870, at 19 years of age. The three scrap-books in which he preserved the programmes of concerts in which he sang or conducted proved his activity.\r\nHe joined the Bristol Orpheus Society in 1872, the Bristol Madrigal Society in 1873, and in 1872 took part in the male voice choir which Alfred Stone led to victory at the National Music Meetings at the Crystal Palace. In 1865 he had entered business in the office of Messrs W. D. and H. O. Wills, and this he continued till 1875. In 1873 the Bristol Musical Festival was established,Alfred Stone becoming choirmaster, secretary, and manager. Mr Kidner gave up business in order to help him in the second festival of 1876, with the intention of joining the ranks of professional musicians - an intention which was afterwards realised. The association with Mr Alfred Stone continued until 1878, when all Bristol was shocked and grieved by the former's sudden and premature death. Mr Kidner stepped into the post left vacant, and became secretary of the Festival.\r\nMr Kidner began as a teacher in 1878 at Sneyd Park Church. In 1883-5 he attended the summer term of the Tonic Sol-fa College, and spoke in warmest terms of the experience gained there. He took the A. C. while at the College in solo singing, being the first to pass in that branch. On the formation of the Bristol section of the National Society of Professional Musicians (now known as the Incorporated Society of Musicians), Mr Kidner was one of the earliest to be selected a member. He took a prominent part in the discussions at the annual meeting of the Society at Bristol in 1890, and sang the prize song composed by Mr W. Noel Johnson. In 1884, with the help of lantern slides, he lectured on Vocal Physiology in Bristol. For two years he was conductor of the 'Bristol Choirs Association' uniting choirs formed out of various Nonconformist church choirs in the district, which held weekly rehearsals and gave sacred concerts and musical services in many places. When this Association came to an end Mr Kidner started the Bristol and Clifton Philharmonic Society.\r\nSince 1887 he, for many years, conducted the Midsomer Norton Choral Society. The town only counts 5,000 inhabitants but there were 120 members in the choir, and oratorios were given with band. Here Mr Kidner had an elementary class as well. The Knowle District Choral Society was also under his baton. At the Bath High School for Girls, the head mistress, Miss Frith, warmly seconded his work. She was most desirous of introducing sight-singing. In Bristol and Clifton he taught singing at a number of boys' and girls' schools, giving usually an hour a week. In the girls' schools, the Tonic Sol-fa was quickly applied to the old notation, but in the boys' schools Tonic Sol-fa only was taught, and the boys liked it best. Mr Kidner had some striking experiences of the unmusical qualities of middle class boys. For several years he was choirmaster of Sneyd Park Church, and before that was organist of Christ Church, Pill.\r\nThe great feature in the life of Mr Kidner was the formation of the Society of Bristol Gleemen, of which he remained conductor for a long period, and only relinquished the direction when severe illness overtook him. It was at the old Athenaeum which has since become the Liberal Club, that a meeting was held on January 13th, 1886, in response to a circular issued by Mr Kidner, and the organisation was founded. The first officers appointed were as follow:- President, Mr F. Wills; vice-president, Mr E. G. Clarke; hon secretaries, Mr F. Wallis Stoddart and Mr James Stevens; hon treasurer Mr W. F. Warton; conductor Mr Walter J. Kidner; committee - Messrs R. M. Hatch, C.W. Warren, Percy Baldwin, W. C. Oatway, W. M. Penny, and T. Protheroe; librarian, Mr R. S. Kidner. There was a roll of 90 members at the initial Ladies' Night, in 1887, 15 being honorary members. In the preface to the book of words of the first Ladies' Night it was announced that 'the Executive Committee are unable to include in the programme, with one exception, glees by English composers. English glees and part-songs are, as a rule, written for the male alto, and as the Gleemen are all either tenors or basses, such music would be useless to them. It is proposed, as soon as possible, to invite English composers to write glees for the tenor voice; and the committee hope in the near future to present original music by English writers.' How this  promise has been redeemed may be gathered by the perusal of a list of original glees and other writings, all by English composers, which have been given at different dates and added to the repertory of the Gleemen.\r\nWith Mr Kidner at their head, the Society not only sang on the occasion of their Ladies' Night in Bristol, but permitted the inhabitants of some other towns to have the gratification of listening to their glees. In the last century the members thus sang at Midsomer Norton, in 1887; Bath, 1888; Norton Hall, near Bath, 1890; Pontypridd, 1896; Newport, 1897; Newport, 1898; Bath, 1899. Since 1896 the practice of introducing a well-known lady vocalist as a contrast to a male voice choir, and the eminent soprano, Miss Lucile Hill, made her first appearance in Bristol in that year. In March, 1907, the Society held a coming-of-age concert at the Victoria Rooms. Mr Kidner gave proof of his skill in the composition of part songs, and on that occasion 'An Indian Lullaby' by him was given as well as his more attractive effort, 'Lull me to sleep'. Other pleasing productions by Mr Kidner also in the repertoire of the Society are 'A Sailor's Song' and 'The Silent Land'.\r\nAnother society with which he had associations was Bristol Choral Society, conducted by Mr George Riseley, his duties here being, as in the case of the Festival Society, secretarial. His genial disposition and business habits enabled him to carry on the work appertaining to his engagement in a manner satisfactory to the society and agreeable to those with whom he came in contact.",

14/03/1910,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Sir Edward Payson Wills,"DEATH OF SIR E. P. WILLS\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MEMOIR\r\n\r\nWe deeply regret to announce the death of Sir Edward Payson Wills, Bart, which occurred at the residence of his daughter, at Woodside, Stoke Bishop. The deceased baronet had suffered from ill-health for many months, but not until recently did his condition give cause for great anxiety. Sir Edward was born in 1834, and was the second surviving son of the late Mr Henry Overton Wills of Bristol. His ancestors came from Cornwall and settled in Bristol nearly a century and a half ago. The family name is derived from the Rev. William Wills, a Cornish rector, who was ejected from his living at the Restoration of Charles II. The grandfather and father of Sir Edward were staunch Bristol Nonconformists. Mr H. O. Wills, the grandfather, was the intimate friend and co-labourer of Rowland Hill and Robert Hall. Sir Edward's father, also Mr H. O. Wills, gave proof of his ardour as a Dissenter by the support which he gave to Bristol Tabernacle, Highbury, and Redland Park Chapels. He was looked to especially when the function of laying the foundation stone of a new chapel or school had to be laid, and his collection of silver trowels resulting from these engagements was large and interesting, judging by the inscriptions.\r\nSir Edward married in 1858 Miss Mary Ann Pearce, the eldest daughter of the late Mr J. Chaning Pearce, F.G.S., of Montague House, Bath, and was predeceased by his wife, who died in 1891. The deceased was a member of the well-known tobacco manufacturing firm of Messrs W. D. and H. O. Wills when the business was carried on in Mary-le-port Street, and he was made a director of the Imperial Tobacco Company of Great Britain and Ireland, when the amalgamation of the important undertakings involved took place.\r\nIn 1899 Sir Edward was created K.C.B. by the late Queen Victoria as a recognition of his generous gift of the building and grounds for the Convalescent Home. He will probably be recollected principally on account of his liberality in connection with the Convalescent Home. In February, 1897, there was a meeting of influential citizens to commemorate the conclusion of the sixtieth year of the reign of Queen Victoria. It was agreed that a Convalescent Home should be established at a cost of about Â£50,000. Shortly afterwards it was announced that Mr H. O. Wills and Mr E. P. Wills had offered Â£10,000 each provided that the above-mentioned amount for the Convalescent Home was obtained in full. Some subscriptions were increased, and Mr E. P. Wills increased his amount to Â£20,000 by the purchase of Wyanflete House, Durdham Down, built a few years previously for a boarding school. When the total sum promised for the Convalescent Home had realized Â£80,000, it was decided to make a further effort to raise the aggregate to Â£100,000. Mr E. P. Wills contributed Â£5,000 to this object. When, on November 15th, 1899, Queen Victoria, visited Bristol for the purpose of opening the Home, Mr E. P. Wills (President of the Home), who had been presented to her Majesty by the Lord Mayor, handed her a gold and jewelled letter weight, enamelled with the Royal Arms, her Majesty's monogram, the arms of Bristol, and a view of the Council House. In the centre was a diamond button, to which an electric wire was attached, and the Queen pressing the button, the great door of the Convalescent Home flew open. Mr E. P. Wills, who had received the intimation that he would forthwith become a Knight Commander of the Bath, in honour of the visit of the Queen, held a reception at the Victoria Rooms, assisted by his daughter. Nearly a thousand guests were invited, including the nobility and gentry of the neighbouring counties, the Bishops of Bristol, Bath and Wells, Hereford, and Clifton, the Mayors and Mayoresses of many neighbouring towns, and the officers of the army, navy, and volunteers, whose forces so largely contributed to the success of the day's pageant. Sir Edward remained president of the Home till his death.\r\nHe received his baronetcy in 1904. He was a justice of the peace for the county of Gloucester, a member of the Executive Committee of the training ship Formidable. He was also a local director of the Northern Assurance Company, whose branch office is in the Exchange. He unsuccessfully contested St. Mary Redcliff Ward for the seat in the Municipal Council in 1880, and Bedminster West in 1883. In the year 1880 he was President of the Anchor Society.\r\nIn various ways Sir Edward rendered assistance to local Church efforts. In 1893 there was a meeting convened at the Chapter House, Bristol, at the instance of the Bishop, in order to consider the desirability of taking steps to extend the inadequate Church accommodation in various populous districts. Towards this object Sir Edward contributed Â£1,000. In February of last year Sir Edward placed the sum of Â£15,000 at the disposal of the Bishop of the Diocese. One-third of the gift was allotted by the donor to the redemption of the mortgage on the Episcopal residence, including all payments of interest and of portions of capital. The Bishop and his successors were hence freed from this burden. The remaining Â£10,000 was allotted to Church purposes within the diocese. In consultation with the donor and members of the donor's family, it was decided that Â£2,000 should be given to head the appeal for a church at St. Ambrose, Rose Green, and that Â£8,000 should be invested to form a permanent 'Wills Fund', from which the Bishop and his successors might improve the income of benefices in their gift and quicken the flow of promotion in the diocese by augmenting their patronage and assisting aged incumbents of benefices in their gift to retire on pensions.\r\nAt the time the subject of the University of Bristol was being rapidly and urgently pushed forward, Sir Edward's eldest son, Mr Edward Chaning Wills, gave a subscription of Â£10,000 to the University fund.\r\nIn addition to his residence at Stoke Bishop, Sir Edward was the owner of Clapton Manor, Somerset.\r\nAt his domain, Hazlewood, Stoke Bishop, Sir Edward took pleasure in farming upon a moderate scale. He was fond of animals, especially horses, and took an especial pleasure in securing possession of any horse that took his fancy, if he thought it was for sale. though living in an unobtrusive fashion, he kept in touch with many public movements, and when the Bristol Association held its meeting in Bristol, in 1898, he gave a garden party at his residence.",

15/02/1909,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Arthur Lee,"DEATH OF MR ARTHUR LEE\r\n\r\nA PROMINENT BRISTOL MERCHANT\r\n\r\nBRILLIANT CAREER TERMINATED IN LONDON\r\n\r\nThe sudden death of Mr Arthur Lee, managing director of Arthur Lee Bros., Ltd., marble merchants, of Bristol and London, will come as a great shock to his numerous intimate friends in many circles of life in Bristol. For the past three years Mr Lee had resided in London, and it was at his metropolitan residence, 37, Woodville Gardens, Ealing, that he died. Although his removal from Bristol somewhat reduced his activity in  public affairs, he not infrequently visited the city, where in earlier years he had made, and always retained, a  reputation as a gentleman of sound commercial instincts and estimable personal qualities. His interest in the city  did not fade with the change of his residence from Berkeley Square, Clifton, to London, and he was frequently to be seen at business meetings, or on the magisterial bench, he having been a justice of the peace  for the past eleven years.\r\nThe deceased gentleman, who was 57 years of age, was the son of the late Mr William Lee, a Devonshire  gentleman, who took a considerable part in public affairs in Bristol, and was in the City Council for some time. In his younger days, Mr Arthur Lee was a successful athlete, and the activity and  briskness which this generated were always noticeable in his manner in later years. The branch of sport which commended itself to him was that of rowing, and nearly 40 years ago he was  a member of the Bristol Ariel Rowing Club. He was recognised as one of the best oarsmen in the West of England, and in 1873 he,  with Messrs Sawnders, Adams, and Blew, won the City Challenge Vase at Saltford Regatta, for the first time.  It is a curious  coincidence that his death should occur 36 years later on Saltford Regatta day. Later in life, the  bicycle supplied his principal form of exercise.\r\nMr Arthur Lee was a man of 'many parts' and his interest, amounting frequently to enthusiasm, took him into social, literary, scientific, commercial, and political circles, while even as an amateur actor he showed marked ability, and many will recollect the skill he displayed in his occasional appearances at the theatre. From an early age he was a member of the old Parliamentary Debating Society, and no doubt the experience gained with that body qualified him to become an able debater upon the subjects on which he subsequently  specialised. His work of a social character was given considerable scope during the time he was hon. secretary  of the Park Row Industrial School for Boys. He was strikingly gifted with  his pen, and contributed many  articles on literary, scientific, political, and commercial subjects to newspapers  and magazines. These included a series of letters to the 'Western Daily Press' in 1887 and 1890 on Irish  affairs, and they were the outcome of visits made by him to the 'Emerald Isle'. His book on 'Marble and Marble Workers' - a subject on which he was well qualified to  write - obtained a very wide circulation, not only in Great Britain, but in America, Mr J. C. Branner, the State Geologist of Arkansas, frequently quoting from it in his report of the geological resources of that State.\r\nMr Lee's commercial activities were by no means confined to the particular trade with which he was directly associated, and he brought a keen intellect to bear on the many problems of commerce. The fruits of these studies he from time to time gave to Bristol merchants, through the medium of the Bristol Chamber of Commerce, and to commercial men of the county generally though the Associated Chambers. His association with the local chamber extended over a great many years, and a more energetic member that body could not have. After being vice-president, he filled the presidential chair in 1901. He was a strong advocate of the compulsory adoption of the metric system of weight and measures, and on behalf on the Bristol association brought the matter before the Associated Cambers in London, where it was unanimously carried. In this direction, therefore, he did his part to bring to a practical issue a proposal of importance of which was long recognised by members of the British Association.\r\nAnother subject to which Mr Lee devoted much attention was that of Banking and Currency. His reply to Lord Farrar on 'Legal Tender' was adopted as the official reply of the Bi-Metallic League, of which body he was at one time a member of the Executive Council, and vice-president of the West of England branch. He read a paper on 'The Currency Question in the United States, and its Bearing on British Interests', before the Economic Section of the British Association, at Liverpool, in 1896. This paper was largely circulated in the United States. He was an able supporter of the propagandism on this question of currency undertaken by the Bristol Chamber of Commerce. Year after year resolutions on the question were sent from Bristol to the Associated Chambers, and in view of the discussions Mr Lee spent much time in collecting facts and figures bearing upon a complicated subject and in mastering the various details. The results were published in book form, and commanded much attention. At the London meeting of the Association, in March 1908, Sir Albert Rollit acknowledged the services which Mr Lee and the Bristol Chamber had rendered to the commercial and mercantile community in drawing attention to the administration of financial institutions like the Bank of England. On that occasion Mr Lee took charge of the Bristol resolution, which was adopted, and he and Mr J. H. Howell, of Bristol, were appointed members of a special committee instructed to carry it into effect. This resolution referred to the need of the Bank of England publishing periodical returns of balances, bills discounted, etc., and as the bank replied that they could not comply with the request, further action was deemed desirable. At the Cardiff meeting of the Associated Chambers, in September, 1908, he again took charge of the Bristol resolution which called for the appointment of a committee to take into consideration the restrictive laws relating to currency and banking in the United Kingdom, and their effect upon the trade and commerce of the country. The resolution was carried, and a committee appointed, Mr Lee and Mr Howell being two of its members. This committee prepared an exhaustive report, and, in the absence of Mr Faithfull Begg, the chairman of the committee, it fell to Mr A. Lee's lot to introduce it at the meeting of the Associated Chambers in London in March last. This he did with customary ability, and the result was that further progress has been made in the direction desired, the position being that the recommendations of the committee are to be discussed by financial experts prior to March next, when they will be again brought before the Associated Chambers. Mr Lee attended one of the series of lectures given in the spring in Bristol, by Prof. H. B. Lees Smith, on the subject, and expressed his views, during the discussion which followed the lecture. Another subject on which he specialised in connection with the Bristol Chamber was that of canal development, and he also brought this matter before the Associated Chambers. It is no doubt chiefly due to his advocacy that the present Royal Commission was appointed to investigate the matter. On the occasion of the visit of the British Association to Bristol, Mr Lee was recognised as possessing just qualities to fit him for the possession of local hon. secretary, an office which he jointly filled with Mr Bertram Rogers with conspicuous ability. For many years he was closely connected with the political organisations of the city. Prior to the split of 1886, he was a Liberal, but became the first secretary of the Bristol Liberal Unionist Association, which was formed in that year. He was also at one time one of the hon. secretaries of the Bristol North Unionist Club.  For a number of years he was a member of the City Council, but retired in 1903 owing to pressure of business. Mr Lee was a Unitarian, and during his residence in this city was a regular attendant at Lewin's Mead Meeting.",
08/07/1909,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Samuel Day Wills,"DEATH OF MR SAMUEL DAY WILLS\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce that Mr Samuel Day Wills died yesterday morning in his 73rd year, at his residence, Stainmoor, Pembroke Road, Clifton. The deceased was the son of the late Mr H. O. Wills, brother of the late Sir Frederick Wills, Sir Edward Payson Wills, and Mr H. O. Wills, and half brother of Mr Frank Wills, Mr Grahame Wills, and Mr Stephen Wills, and cousin of Lord Winterstoke. Born at Bristol on March 14th, 1837, Mr Samuel Day Wills was educated at Taunton and Amersham. He first married Miss Elizabeth Granger Bourne, daughter of Mr W. T. Bourne, of Walker Hall, Staindrop, Durham, and secondly Miss Eva Blanche Tubbs, fourth daughter of Mr C. F. Tubbs, of Beechfield, near Plymouth. He had seven children by his first wife, and one child by his second wife. For many years he was in business as an oil and colour merchant, joining an old firm in Castle Green. It was carried on by William Evans and Company, and afterwards by Hurndall, Hellier, and Wills. The deceased quitted the business about even or eight years ago, his place being filled by his son, Mr Norman Wills. Another son, Mr Harold Wills, was at Cambridge University, where he took his degree, and then for a short time was in business. He, however, determined to become a missionary, and has laboured with success at Trivaudrum in South India. The deceased was very prominently identified with the congregational Church movement in Bristol, and gave liberally to the support of its churches and other agencies. He was chiefly identified with Redland Park Church, having left the Clifton Down Church to support the ministry of the late Rev. Urijah Thomas. The Wills family were largely responsible for the erection of the sanctuary at Redland Park, the late Messrs W. D. Wills (father of Lord Winterstoke) and H. O. Wills, after the opening services, contributing a substantial amount in order that the church might be opened free from debt. For forty years Mr S. D. Wills was deacon, and some time ago he and the late Mr Wilberforce Tribe were made honorary deacons. The deceased was always in the front when any movement was started in connection with the church, and he became from the commencement treasurer of the Urijah Thomas's Memorial Ministers' Seaside Home of Rest at Morthoe, North Devon, an institution which has been widely appreciated by pastors, who there enjoyed well-earned holidays. A sphere of work which commended itself greatly to Mr S. D. Wills was that in connection with the Young Men's Christian Association. His name occurs in the list of members as the 192nd, and for many years he acted as treasurer, interesting himself much in the jubilee celebration in 1903, when Mr Joseph Storrs fry completed his twenty-fifth year as president, and Mr Henry Daniel and Mr James Inskip, who had long served the association, were honorary secretaries. The deceased was a magistrate for the city of Bristol, having been appointed to a seat on the bench in 1881. His cousin, Lord Winterstoke, appointed in 1866, is the oldest city magistrate. The sympathies of the deceased were wide, and he was connected in the management of many undertakings. He became treasurer of the Congregational Extension Committee, was associated in the control of the Convalescent Home on Durdham Down, and the Home of Rest on Durdham Down. He was a president of the Anchor Society, a director of the London Missionary Society, member of the committee of the Bristol Dispensary, chairman (1899) of the Congregational County Union of Gloucestershire and Herefordshire, member of the committee of the Congregational Union of England and Wales, and deacon of Kingsland Congregational Church, Bristol. In 1875 he was elected a Fellow of the Chemical Society. The deceased travelled extensively on the Continent, and also in the United States, India, Egypt, and other places. He suffered of late years from heart disease, and had expressed a wish to retire to a quiet country spot, but this desire was not to be carried into effect for he passed away more speedily that had been anticipated. His loss will be mourned generally, as he not only gave his services readily in support of any cause which commended itself to him but he also contributed liberally where pecuniary assistance was needed.",
23/05/1910,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr August Krauss,"DEATH OF MR A. KRAUSS\r\n\r\nThe numerous friends of Mr August Krauss, the well-known builder and contractor, will regret to learn that he died on Saturday evening, at his residence, Priory Road, Tyndall's Park, after an illness extending over many weeks. Mr Krauss, who was known for many years in connection with important undertakings in various parts of the country, was the son of Ignato Krauss. His early years were spent in Germany, where he was born at Schwalbach, near Frankfort-on-Main, in 1842. He came to Bristol about 40 years ago, and for some years carried on business in Colston Street, afterwards having his workshops and yard at Lawrence Hill. A shrewd man of business, he was led to see in the agitation going forward to give comfort to cabmen and provide them with covering during inclement weather an opportunity to make a start in what was then a novel direction. Hence he constructed cabmen's shelters in various parts of Bristol, and he used to say that he regarded this as his first work of any importance. When the local tramways came to be laid he had developed a business as contractor upon a considerable scale, and under Mr Kincaid, the engineer consulted by the company, he was instrumental in the construction of many of the lines owned by the Bristol Company. He also did tramway work elsewhere through Mr Kincaid, and left no stone unturned to succeed in his enterprise as a contractor. Finding that tenders were invited for a line, of which Mr Kincaid was engineer, he started early one morning for London to submit estimates to him, preparing figures in the train so that he might be ready to place them before the engineer at his office. Amongst the many large contracts carried out by Mr Krauss may be instanced the Newport, Darleston, York, and Bath tramways. Prominent in the undertakings with which the name of the deceased will always be associated is the Weston-super-Mare sea-front improvements, which have been such a source of attraction to visitors at that favourite watering place. When the first section had been completed great rejoicings were indulged in by the large crowds assembled, and Mr Krauss, who invited the leading men of the town to a luncheon held near the shore, was warmly congratulated upon the success of his work. When another section came to be constructed he had to contend against difficulties on account of the tempestuous weather that prevailed during a portion of the time, and in a violent gale much of his work was washed away. Ultimately, however, the sea front came to be completed to the satisfaction of the town commissioners. For a few years Mr Krauss resided at Weston-super-Mare, in a large house near Ellenborough Park. He had married Miss Alice Ellcott of London, and during a long time she suffered from a spinal complaint, and a stay at Weston-super-Mare was recommended by her medical advisor. Locally Mr Krauss was the contractor for an important project, covering the water space from the Stone Bridge to the Drawbridge, and in place of the latter antiquated structure, building St. Augustine's Bridge. He also was responsible for the erection of the spacious temporary structure on the site in which there was a fine industrial exhibition that formed a great attraction for some months. In respect to the construction of waterworks, the deceased became almost as well known as in the laying of tramways, and he was successful in his operations at Bridgwater, Frome, and Highbridge besides carrying out a large contract in Somerset for the Bristol Water Company. He was responsible for some extensive structures, and in this city he built the Constitutional Club premises in St. Stephen Street and the Carlton Chambers. In his own trade he had filled high positions, having been vice-president of the Bristol Master Builders' Association in 1884 and 1892, and the president of that association in 1893, 1896 and 1898. He was also founder and president of the West of England Federation of Builders. An ardent Freemason, he was a member of the Royal Clarence Lodge. He was fond of outdoor amusements and a keen sportsman. For many years he spent his holidays on Dartmoor, where he constructed a rude dwelling, and in company with certain friends of his large circle, he enjoyed shooting and fishing. His son has developed great enterprise in respect to the occupation of a builder and contractor, and can boast of much experience in America. Of his daughters, one has developed talent as an artist. The wife of the deceased has been dead several years.",
15/02/1909,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Arthur Baker,"DEATH OF MR ARTHUR BAKER\r\n\r\nBristol has lost a prominent citizen in Mr Arthur Baker, whose death we regret to announce, took place at his residence, Henbury Hill House, yesterday. The news will come as a painful surprise to many Bristolians, for Mr Baker was sufficiently well to be in the city on Friday. On the day previous to that he was present at the annual meeting of the Bristol Clergy Society, held at the Lecture Hall of Emmanuel Church, Clifton, and in speaking to a resolution, bore testimony to the help the society had received from the late Sir Robert Symes. It was not until Saturday that Mr Baker was taken ill, and he passed away yesterday about noon. Mr Baker, who was 67 years of age, was the son of the late Mr William Baker, corn merchant and miller of this city. He was born on June 27th, 1841, and was educated at the Bristol Grammar School. Entering his father's office in 1857 he, nine years later, became a partner in the firm of Messrs William Baker and Sons, and when in 1890 the firm was amalgamated with that of Spiller and Co., Ltd, Cardiff, under the name of Spillers and Baker, Limited, he was made a director of the company. As is well known, this is one of the largest milling and corn trade businesses in the United Kingdom, with mills in Bristol, Cardiff, and Newcastle-on-Tyne. In 1892 he became chairman of the company, and held a similar position in the firm of Messrs. Hudden and Company, Limited, tobacco manufacturers. He was one of the local directors of the Royal Insurance Company, and was also a director of the Taff Vale Railway Company, the half-yearly meeting of which he attended in Bristol on Tuesday. Although at the time of his death he was not a member of the City Council he served the city of his birth on that body for many years, being returned for the ward of Redcliff as far back as 1874. He served on most of the important Corporation committees, and was chairman of the Traffic Sub-Committee of the Docks Committee.\r\nEducational, religious, philanthropical and political work also claimed Mr Baker's interests. In 1869 he became a member of the Society of Merchant Venturers, and filled the office of warden in 1873, and that of master in 1875. In politics he was a Conservative, and filled for some time the position of chairman of the Conservative Association in Bristol South. For several years he was a churchwarden at St. Mary Redcliff, and took a leading part in the movement for the restoration of the church. He was a lay member of the Bristol Diocesan Conference, and a member of the committee of the Bristol Diocesan branch of the Queen Victoria Clergy Fund. The deceased gentleman was treasurer and one of the managers of the church schools of the parish of St. Mary Redcliff, and was also a governor of Colston's Hospital and Colston's Girl School. He was a member of the Committee of Management of the Merchant Venturers' Technical College, and in his capacity of one of the governors of the Grammar School, the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, and the Red Maids' School. He was also on the committee of the Bristol General Hospital. Mr Baker was a justice of the peace for the city and county of Bristol, and in 1892-3 occupied the position of Sheriff. It is interesting to recall that he was one of the earliest members of the Volunteer force, having joined the 1st Gloucester Volunteer Rifles in 1859. Mr Baker married in 1866, Amy Mary, the eldest daughter of the late Mr Charles Joseph Vining, of Bristol and Backwell, Somerset.",
04/10/1910,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr John Miller,"DEATH OF MR JOHN MILLER\r\n\r\nA LONG AND HONOURED CAREER\r\n\r\nIt is with regret that Mr John Miller on Sunday passed away, at the age of 83 years, at his residence, Freshford Villa, Richmond Hill. The deceased gentleman, who during many years was one of the best-known solicitors in Bristol, was articled to the late Mr Henry Abbot (whose practice is now carried on by Messrs Abbot, Pope, Brown, and Abbot). He was admitted a solicitor in 1850, and soon gained an extensive practice. For 25 years he remained professional advisor to the Bristol and West of England Trade Protection Society, of which Mr Matthew Dunlop was president and Mr Parsons secretary. He also for some time acted in the same capacity in connection with the Great Western Colliery Company, at first by himself, and subsequently in conjunction with Mr James Inskip. Mr Miller was associated with the pioneers of tramway enterprise in Bristol, a movement in which he was interested being afterwards developed and successfully carried on by gentlemen for whom Messrs Stanley and Wesbrough acted. During his career the deceased became a familiar figure in the old Bankruptcy Court at the Guildhall, over which Mr M. D. Hill presided as commissioner, and also in the County Court after the former tribunal ceased to exist. For a time his office remained in the Albion Chambers (the rooms which Mr Sinnott, solicitor, at present, occupies); then he removed to Whitson Chambers, which were situated on the site of that handsome structure in Nicholas Street, the present Stock Exchange. In 1882 he came to St. Stephen's Chambers, being the first to occupy a set of offices in New Baldwin Street.\r\nMr Miller had a unique position among local solicitors on account of the many appointments he held. He was commissioner for affidavits, examining witnesses, etc., in the superior court of Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, South-West Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania, Cape Colony, and the superior court of Bengal and Bombay. In respect to the legal profession, he did all in his power to uphold its dignity, and in consequence he enjoyed the esteem of those solicitors with whom he was brought into contact. He made a practice of attending the meetings of the Bristol Incorporated Law Society, and acted as a member of the council as long as his health permitted. In the report of the council for 1908 there occurred the following:- 'It is now exactly 50 years since Mr Miller was elected a member of the former Bristol Law Library Society, and since the formation of the present society in 1871, he has continually been a member of the council, except for a period of one year in 1873, and a period of three years from 1876 to 1879, during which, under the then existing articles of association, he was not eligible. For the last 29 years his membership of the council has, therefore, been uninterrupted. While taking an active interest in every matter that came before the council, the library was for many years a special object of his attention, and the grateful thanks not only of his colleagues, but also of the whole profession in Bristol, are due to him for his assiduous care for everything that tended to maintain the honour and integrity of the profession.' The deceased continued in active practice till 1904, when he retired, though still taking out his certificate, which, indeed, he continued to do till his death. In 1905 Messrs Meade-King  and Sons took over his practice, and the firm was known as John Miller and Co. Then other partners joined, and the present style is Messrs Meade-King, Cooke, Wansey, and John Miller. The deceased was of an eminently kindly disposition, and that  he possessed characteristics which rendered him esteemed by  those in his service was shown by the fact that Mr J. Bucknell,  his managing clerk, remained with him during many years, and that  Mr Edwin Crosby, who succeeded him as managing clerk on his  death, came as a boy of 14, in 1867, to Mr Miller's office, and holds an important position with the present firm.",
14/01/1910,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Edwin Larcombe,"THE LATE MR EDWIN LARCOMBE\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death of Mr Edwin Larcombe, which occurred on Wednesday morning after a long illness at his residence, 503, Stapleton Road. The deceased was well known and highly respected in friendly society and Volunteer circles. For nearly half-a-century he had been an active worker in connection with the Bristol District of the Manchester Unity of Oddfellows. He served the office of Unity auditor, and might have been a member of the Board of Directors many years ago had his ambitions influenced him in that direction. He was a man of great administrative ability, who had a thorough grasp of all important questions relating to the government of the Order, and his valuable services will be greatly missed. Mr Larcombe's career in Oddfellowship dates back to April, 1862, when, at the age of 20 years, he joined the Great Britain lodge at Bristol. He joined the Past Grands' Lodge in 1864, serving the offices of Notary, Vice-Excelsior, and Grand Excelsior in 1870, 1871, and 1872 respectively. He transferred from the Great Britain Lodge to the Friendly Mechanics' Lodge in  February, 1866, served the lodge chairs in 1867 and 1868, was elected Provincial Deputy Grand Master in 1869, and Grand Master in 1870. He was chairman of the Oddfellows' Hall Committee from its inception until the opening of the building in Rupert Street, Bristol, in 1872. He served as Noble Grand and Grand Master of the Thornbury Castle Lodge in the year of its opening,  1870, and successively filled the offices of vice-president and president of the District Widow and Orphans' Fund in 1870 and 1871, and was trustee of that fund from 1872 until it merged into the District in 1877. He was permanent secretary of the Avon Lodge in 1874 and 1875, receiving a presentation of a gold Albert, with locket, from that lodge on his retirement. He was appointed permanent secretary of the mother lodge of the district -  the Great Western - in 1887, and of the District Juvenile Society when it was formed in 1894, and of the Brotherly Love Lodge in July 1894. He was presented with a writing desk, suitably inscribed, in 1895, by the members of the Brotherly Love Lodge, and in 1896 the Great Western Lodge recognised his invaluable services as permanent secretary by presenting him with a gold watch and a P.P.G.M. jewel, the then Grand Master of the Unity, Bro. Wm. Orford White, making the presentation on behalf of the lodge. He was the first Noble Grand of the Thomas Adams Lodge, Staple Hill, in 1893, and was one of the trustees.\r\nFor twenty years he was one of the District Examiners of Lodge Books, from which position he retired in 1894; and in 1897, on the resignation by Mr Thomas Adams of the office of Prov C. S. - which the veteran Oddfellow had held for 47 years - the choice fell unanimously on Bro. Larcombe, and the District had had every reason to be satisfied with its choice, for the new Prov. C. S. carried out his duties most efficiently. His great desire was to see the whole of the lodges in the District Management Committee entrusted him with the preparation of a scheme for relieving the lodges which showed considerable deficiency on the valuations of a portion of their liabilities, on the condition that the lodges themselves co-operated in the effort to improve their financial positions. The scheme drafted by the Prov C.S. was approved by the District and the Unity valuers, and has been in operation with very satisfactory results. Other reforms carried through during his tenure of office includes the payment of full table benefits in the district, the doctors' interchange, and the lodge investment scheme, which is proving very useful to members. From time to time Bro. Larcombe contributed to useful discussions on various subjects connected with friendly society work; and he was one of the witnesses examined before Lord Rothchild's Commission on the question of old-age pensions. He represented his District at many A.M.C.'s. At the Bristol A.M.C., in 1896, he was chosen Unity auditor, which office he served for the usual period. In carrying out the arrangements for the Bristol A.M.C. he acted as general secretary, and was also secretary of the executive and finance, and lodgings committees, and his services were recognised by the presentation of a handsomely-carved bookcase. He resigned his secretaryship of the Great Western Lodge about six months ago owing to failing health, and he had also sent in his resignation of the office of Corresponding Secretary of the District. Taking a broad view of friendly society work, Bro. Larcombe identified himself with the interests of other societies. He was an honorary member of the A.O.F., and on the formation of the Bristol District Friendly Societies' Council in 1900, he was elected vice-president, succeeding to the office of president in the following March. He was adopted by the Council as their candidate at the School Board election in January, 1901, and was duly elected.\r\nMar Larcombe rendered good service in connection with the Volunteers. He joined the Bristol Rifles at the age of 17, in the year 1859, when the late Volunteer movement commenced, transferred to the Bristol Engineers in 1878, and rose to the rank of Regimental Quarter Master-Sergeant, retiring in 1891 (having reached the age limit) after more than 32 years' service, and receiving the Volunteer long-service medal. Sympathy will be felt for Mrs Larcombe and the members of the family in their bereavement.",
19/02/1909,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Sir Frederick Wills,"DEATH OF SIR FREDERICK WILLS\r\n\r\nA DISTINGUISHED CAREER\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce that another prominent Bristolian has passed away in Sir Frederick Wills, Bart., a gentleman who, in the course of the allotted span of three score years and ten, served this city as a town councillor, a member of Parliament, and in other ways, in addition to being identified with the direction of one of the leading businesses of the city. Sir Frederick underwent an operation some while ago for an internal complaint, and appeared to derive considerable benefit therefrom.At the annual meeting of the Imperial Tobacco Company on Tuesday, Mr Mayo Gunn announced that he was recovering from his illness, but on Wednesday, while staying at Cannes, Sir Frederick suffered a serious relapse, and though hopes were entertained as to his recovery, the sad news reached Bristol yesterday afternoon that he had died that morning from heart failure. Lady Wills was with her husband when he passed away. Deceased was born in Bristol on the 21st November, 1838, and was the seventh son of the late Mr Henry Overton Wills, of Cotham Park. Sir Frederick was educated at the Independent College, Taunton, and at Amersham School (Mr West's), Buckinghamshire. Upon completing his school studies, he came straight to business in Bristol, becoming identified with the well known firm of tobacco manufacturers, Messrs W. D. and H. O. Wills, of which his father was a partner. This famous house is the oldest one engaged in the tobacco trade in Bristol. It has been established considerably over a century and a half. Sir Frederick remained in Bristol in connection with the firm until 1864, when he went to London to undertake the management of the Metropolitan branch of the concern, which had just been founded. He continued in this capacity up to the year 1874, and under his capable guidance, and with his keen foresight, the branch developed considerably, and served to extend the already large ramifications of the firm. Upon leaving London, Mr Frederick Wills, as he was then, returned to his native city, and assumed the management of the Bristol business. The city secured him for four years as one of the representatives for Bedminster West Ward, being returned unopposed. In the year 1889 he once more went to London to resume the control of the firm's operations there, and five years later, in 1894, he retired from active work in connection with the concern, upon it being converted into a private limited liability company. In 1897 he was created a Baronet by Lord Salisbury, in consideration of the services he had rendered to the Unionist party on many occasions. He also filled various public offices, notably on the Governing Body of the Bristol Cathedral School, on the Council of the Bristol University College, the committee of the General Hospital, and in the year 1882 he filled the position of President of the Anchor Society, when his collection amounted to the handsome sum of Â£1001.\r\n\r\nHIS POLITICAL CAREER\r\n\r\nThe reference to the Anchor Society introduces the fact that deceased was at that time a Gladstonian Liberal, thus following the tradition of the Wills family. But when Mr Gladstone introduced his Home Rule Bill in 1885, he felt he could no longer endorse the views of the Liberal Chief, and he thereupon joined the Unionist body.\r\nAt the general election in 1895, deceased  made his first essay into Parliament, contesting the Launceston division of Cornwall as a Unionist, against Mr Thomas Owen, also a Bristolian, who was the sitting member. Mr Owen had been returned at the previous election with a majority of nearly a thousand; but Mr Wills reduced the figures by between 300 and 400, the result being: T. Owen, 3633; F. Wills, 2975. Under the circumstances in which he entered the contest, Mr Wills had little expectation of being returned, and the reduction of the majority was considered full payment for the trouble of fighting the seat. In 1898, Mr Owen met his death in a painful manner at his Welsh residence, and Sir Frederick again came forward to contest the constituency; but the Gladstonians had secured the services of Mr Fletcher Moulton, undoubtedly a strong candidate for a Cornish constituency, and Sir Frederick for the second time suffered defeat. It was in 1900 that Sir Frederick became a member of Parliament for his native city, succeeding the Right Hon. Lewis Fry as representative of Bristol North. In his address he rightly claimed 'all his life to have been closely identified with the commerce of our great city, to have the strongest possible interest in her prosperity'. He defeated Sir Clarence Smith by 754 votes, the poll resulting - Sir Frederick Wills, 4936; Sir Clarence Smith, 4182. On account of indifferent health, he retired from parliamentary life in 1906, when Mr J. A. Foote, K.C., became the Unionist candidate, and lost the seat to the Right Hon. Augustine Birrell. While in Parliament, though not prone to rush into debate, Sir Frederick by his knowledge and his kindly shrewdness, enabled Mr Austen Chamberlain to keep from going wholly wrong over his new tobacco duties. To the representation of their case by the hon. baronet the luckless holders of 'stripped' tobacco secured a 0.5d rebate on the amount of 'strip' they held in bond before the Budget. But Sir Frederick himself would have gone further by drawing the line altogether at the tobacco in bond. It was this halving of the concession that caused Sir Frederick, neatly turning a phrase by Sir Conan Doyle to its own improvement, to insist that 'what is morally wrong can never become politically right'. Sir Frederick was often taken as a shy man, but when he once warmed to his subject, he proceeded with excellent force and precision of detail. Naturally, on tobacco he was everything that the man thirsting after information could desire.\r\n\r\nHOBBIES AND PHILANTHROPY\r\n\r\nSir Frederick took great interest in art and music. He was president of the Society of Bristol Gleemen, and frequently sang with them. On evidence of the desire for the welfare of the society was seen in the presentation of a new orchestra. For some years he was hon. secretary of the Bristol School of Art, Queen's Road, in which he succeeded his cousin, Sir William Henry Wills (now Lord Winterstoke). In his early days he was an enthusiastic rowing man, and he always took a great interest in fishing and yachting. A few years ago he was the owner of the celebrated schooner Amphitrite, and was successful in winning several prizes with her, notably in a race with the crack American schooner Yampa, at Cowes. The immense excitement at Cowes when this race was decided in favour of Sir Frederick's craft was very memorable. In 1893 he entered her in the Royal Thames Yacht Club race from the Nore to Dover, against Britannia, Valkyrie, Calluna, and Satania. Amphitrite did well while the wind lasted, but when it came to drifting she was left far behind. Amphitrite was an excellent sea boat, and Sir Frederick did a great deal of cruising in her in the Mediterranean and elsewhere. \r\nAs we already mentioned, Sir Frederick was a director of  the Imperial Tobacco Company, and was re-elected at Tuesday's meeting. Like all members of the Wills family, he was a generous contributor to philanthropic objects. He built a wing to Bournemouth Hospital in memory of his eldest son, and gave a library to Guy's Hospital at a cost of Â£5000. Towards the Bristol University scheme he at first contributed Â£5000, but subsequently gave another Â£5000 in order that his donation might be the means of endowing a chair in the University. Sir Frederick also took great interest in the University College Colston Society, becoming president in the third year of its existence, 1902 when the collection amounted to the substantial sum of Â£414 14s.\r\nSir Frederick married in 1867, Anne, the eldest daughter of the late Rev. James Hamilton, D.D., F.L.S. He had a beautifully-situated residence at Northmoor, Dulverton, in the Exmoor country, and at Manor Heath, Bournemouth, and his London address was Kensington Palace Gardens. His clubs were the Reform, Gresham, and Royal Thames Yacht. He was a breeder of Devon cattle at Northmoor, Dulverton, and he had a farm at Houndsley, near Winterbourne. Some of his cattle were sold yesterday at Taunton. He was a member of Devon and Somerset Hunt Committee, and his eldest son is a member of Dulverton Foxhounds, the immediate meets of which have been cancelled. When in Bristol Sir Frederick resided at Avonwood, Clifton Down, and Lord Winterstoke (his cousin) occupied Hawthorden, the adjoining residence. Deceased leaves a widow, two sons, and three daughters. His eldest son, Mr A. H. Hamilton Wills, died some years ago, and the surviving eldest son is Mr G. A. H. Wills, who was born in 1880, the other son being Mr Noel H. Wills. The daughters are Mrs Douglas Hamilton, whose husband is a member of the well known Hamilton family, Mrs Fellowes, and Miss Kathleen Wills. Mr Frank Wills, who is in Jamaica, is agent for Sir Frederick, and Mr H. W. Secombe Wills is agent for the Dulverton Estate.",

07/12/1908,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Thomas David Taylor,"DEATH OF MR T. D. TAYLOR\r\n\r\nA PROMINENT BRISTOL JOURNALIST\r\n\r\nWe deeply regret to announce the death of Mr Thomas David Taylor, which took place yesterday morning a his residence, Hillside House, Redland Green, after an illness extending over several weeks. Mr T. D. Taylor was born in Bristol on the 6th February, 1823, and was the son of Mr John Taylor, who was for fifty years proprietor and editor of the 'Bristol Mirror'. He was educated at Blundell's School, Tiverton, and in 1848, when at the age of 25, joined his father in journalistic work. For some years he owned and edited the 'Bath Chronicle', but on the death of his father he sold his interests in that journal, and returned to Bristol to renew his work in connection with the 'Mirror', which in 1865 became amalgamated with the 'Bristol Times', owned and edited by the late Mr Joseph Leech, the title then becoming 'The Bristol Daily Times and Mirror'. On the occasion of the silver wedding of the two journals Mr Taylor was presented by the staff with a very fine portrait of himself in oils. The deceased gentleman retired in 1901, so that for rather more than 50 years he was actively and prominently associated with journalistic work in Bristol and the neighbouring city of Bath.\r\nMr Taylor was a gentleman of a school not so often to be met in these days as formerly; he added to a dignified bearing a studied courtesy of manner, which at the same time both impressed and attracted all who were privileged to be in his company. Ever willing to show himself friendly to all, he was a loyal and energetic supporter of the causes which met with the approval of his judgment, while the geniality of his temperament smoothed away all asperity from his advocacy of political or social movements. The kindliness which covered the expression of his views did not in any sense deprive, but rather accentuated his possession of a shrewdness which, while a natural gift, was strongly developed by the experience of men and affairs during a long and busy life. His brother journalists have the most cordial recollections of Mr Taylor's demeanour towards them in all circumstances, and although of recent years they have not had such frequent opportunities as formerly of listening to his enlivening and witty conversation, the memory of his most active days as a working journalist is still with them to stimulate and encourage. In the days of his vigour he was a prolific writer, and his work was marked by great ability. He possessed a very keen sense of humour and his writings at times were in a very happy vein, while when occasion required he could be most trenchant in his criticisms.\r\nMr Taylor did not undertake any civic work, though he was much pressed on several occasions to do so. He was a well-known figure, however, in the public life of the city and possessed qualities which endeared him to all classes of his fellow citizens. Indeed, it has been given to few men to be more widely known or highly respected. He was the Father of the Ancient Society of St. Stephen's Ringers, which he joined in 1846. He had an intimate acquaintance with several distinguished men in his generation, including Mark Lemon and Douglas Jerrold, and several books were dedicated to him at different times by well-known authors. One of the latter was Joseph Hatton, at one time editor of the 'Mirror', and the Rev. A. B. Beaven dedicated his 'Bristol Lists' to Mr Taylor as the 'Grand Old Man of Journalism in Bristol', because in conjunction with Mr F. F. Fox he had given him access to Bristol books and to his rare files of old Bristol newspapers. Mr Taylor's wife, who was the daughter of Dr. Goodenough, a former master of the Grammar School, died many years ago, and last year he had the misfortune to sustain a severe bereavement by the death of his eldest son, Mr J. H. Goodenough Taylor. One of his brothers, Mr Robert Taylor, died recently at Lynton, and another brother, the Rev. Richard Taylor, vicar of Kemble, died a few years ago. His son, Mr Henry Ward Taylor, is one of the directors of the 'Bristol Times and Mirror' Ltd., and his grandson, Mr Lionel Goodenough Taylor, is also a member of the board. The deceased was a Fellow of the Institute of Journalists, and was one of those who signed the petition for a charter of incorporation, which was granted. Mr Taylor was chairman of the Bristol branch of the National Association of Journalists in 1889, when a special conference was held at Bristol and at which it was decided to apply for the Charter, and on that occasion he entertained the visitors with liberal hospitality. He was a member of the local reception committee at the Bristol conference of the Institute in 1903, but owing to failing health was unable to take any active part in the work. He was an honorary member and warm supporter of the Bristol and West of England Press Fund, and was the president at one of its most successful banquets. There are two daughters, viz., Miss Georgina Taylor, a lady well known for her philanthropic work in the city of Bristol, and formerly a member of the Bristol School Board; and Miss Isabella Taylor, who has taken a very active interest in the Bristol Orthopaedic Hospital.",
01/10/1909,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Charles Thomas,"DEATH OF MR CHARLES THOMAS\r\n\r\nAN HONOURED CITIZEN\r\n\r\nIt is with much regret that we announce the death of Mr Charles Thomas, who for many years occupied a high position in the trade of the city, and was always a warm supporter of philanthropic movements. The deceased gentleman, who was 88 years of age, died suddenly at his residence, Pitch and Pay, Stoke Bishop. Mr Thomas had no illness which laid him aside. He was in Bristol on Wednesday afternoon, and has been paying his usual visits to the Commercial Rooms this week. Yesterday morning he was sitting waiting for his breakfast and reading the paper, and the servant found him dead a few minutes later. His sudden death occasioned no surprise, medical warning having been given the family that this might happen. His nephew, Mr Harry Thomas, who was closely associated with the University College, died a few months ago.\r\n\r\nEARLY YEARS\r\n\r\nThe family of which Mr Thomas was a member came to Bristol from Llangadock, Carmarthenshire, the original founder of the important business which has for many years been carried on upon the Broad Plain being Mr Thomas Thomas, the father of the four brothers - Christopher James, Thomas, Herbert, and Charles. The last named was born at Llangadock on August 10th, 1821, and received the early part of his education at the town school. Unfortunately, however, when still a school-boy, he met with an accident to his eye, and it became necessary for him to abandon his studies for eighteen months. Then the family removed to Bristol, and Charles resumed his education, attending Mr F. Norton's School on St. Michael's Hill until the end of 1835. At this time the deceased was not in very robust health, and in 1836 he was sent away to a farm near Cardiff, where he stayed nearly twelve months. Returning to Bristol, he was placed with a German professor, Dr Monck, who live in Southwell Street, and under his tuition acquired some knowledge of the German language. He was taught mathematics by Mr Exley, the father of Mr John Exley, who had a school at Cotham. In the early part of 1838 he had completed his education, and it was then he commenced to learn soap-making, in the factory which had been opened by his father, in conjunction with his brother-in-law, Mr Jones, about 1825.\r\n\r\nHIS BUSINESS CAREER\r\n\r\nThe original factory was in Old Red Lion Yard, Redcliff Street, on the site of premises afterwards occupied by Messrs Henry Prichard and Co., oil merchants. Following the progress of the firm, it may be said that increased trade came slowly but surely, and of the four sons, Christopher James, at the age of 22, was the first to be introduced into the firm, who then carried on business under the style of Jones and Thomas. When Mr Charles Thomas joined the firm in 1838, the soap-making business was carried on in Queen Street, Castle Street, under the style of Thomas Thomas and Sons. Increasing trade made the acquirement of larger premises necessary, and in 1841 Messrs Fripp and Co., soap manufacturers of high standing in Bristol, made overtures which resulted in the amalgamation of the two firms, and a settlement of the new business on the Broad Plain was made. In 1856 Mr Edward Fripp retired, leaving the four brothers who traded as Christopher Thomas and Brothers, and Mr Charles Thomas took the control of the manufacturing  work. He displayed considerable scientific knowledge in the manufacture of soap, and an invention was patented in 1878 in his name and the names of Messrs S. A. King (assistant) and W. J. Fuller (chemist to the firm) for extracting a large portion of the glycerine from the other chemical elements of leys, a substance formerly regarded as waste. Many other improvements were subsequently effected by Mr Charles Thomas in conjunction with experts, and one of these was patented in his name and that of Mr Elbert Domeier, of London. In the year 1853, Mr Gladstone abolished soap duty of Â£14 per ton, and in a very short time a considerable quantity of soap was sold at Â£14 per ton. About this time Mr Thomas, with the sanction of his brothers, made many changes in, and additions to, the premises and machinery, all of which additions were carried out under his personal supervision. During Mr Thomas's active connection with the firm nearly the whole of the works were rebuilt. Mr Thomas gained experienced in nearly all the departments of the works, and for many years he applied himself to the business from early morning to late evening. His ability in connection with the affairs of the business of himself and partners led him to be invited to join other undertakings. He became chairman of the Netham Chemical Works in 1859, and retained the position till 1890, when that undertaking was absorbed in the United Alkali Co. Another local enterprise in which he had a share in the management was the Bristol Water Works Co., of which he was director. He was for some years a director of the Employers' Liability Insurance Corporation, and on the Board of the General and London Hydraulic Power Co. Apart from the Broad Plain Soap Works, however, Mr Thomas, evinced most interest in railway concerns. He became a director of the Midland Railway Company in 1875, succeeding Mr Mercer, who was for some time the Bristol member of the board. Mr Thomas exerted himself for the benefit of Bristol in connection with the Midland system, and his colleagues elected him deputy chairman of the company in 1891, a position which he held for fourteen years. Mr Thomas had a seat on many of the committees of the Midland Railway Company, and was most regular in his attendances. During his connection with the company Mr Thomas saw many important changes and an enormous increase in railway work. His efforts were recognised by Sir Ernest Paget, the chairman of the Midland Company, who paid a well-deserved tribute to his efficiency. Other railways in which Mr Charles Thomas was director were the Taff Vale (of which he was a deputy chairman), and the Somerset and Dorset.\r\n\r\nAS A VOLUNTEER\r\n\r\nIn 1861 Mr Thomas joined the Bristol Rifles on the formation of the corps. He learned his manual drill in the dinner hour at the soap-works, the drill sergeant attending there to  instruct him. He took a keen interest in shooting, and made himself so proficient in the use of the rifle that he succeeded in winning the cross rifle badge, shooting at 900 yards. In those days the rifle range was near Pitch and Pay, and Mr Thomas used to turn out at six o'clock in the morning and, by arrangement with the colonel, meet the sergeant at the range at that hour. He had a good many shares in the old headquarters of the Rifles, and when the premises were sold he devoted Â£800 towards a prize fund to spread over ten years, the condition being that some others would make up Â£50 per annum, so as to make a prize fund of Â£100 a year for ten years. In addition to the Rifles, Mr Thomas also took an interest in the welfare of the Naval Volunteers, and at one time held the commission of a lieutenant. In 1881 Mr Thomas was appointed to the Commission of the Peace for the county of Gloucester, and in 1901 he was appointed a Deputy-Lieutenant of the county.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC DUTIES\r\n\r\nUntil the Home Rule agitation split the party in 1886, Mr Thomas was a staunch Liberal, and proved an active worker in all local elections from 1840 to 1875. After he became a Liberal Unionist he attended the meetings of that body. A few years ago, however, he severed his connection with the Liberal Unionists. He expressed himself strongly against the taxation of food and in 1905 he accompanied Sir William Henry Wills to a large meeting held in Colston Hall, where he received a very hearty welcome, as it was the first time for some years that he had stood upon a liberal platform. In a letter which he subsequently wrote respecting the food question, he explained that he was altogether opposed to its taxation. Mr Thomas never allowed himself to be nominated for any municipal work, because he felt that whilst his brother, Mr Christopher Thomas, was a member of the Council for forty years and mayor in 1874-75, and Mr Herbert Thomas was giving a great deal of time to philanthropic work on the School Board, and as one of the Charity Trustees, it was essential for him to give close attention to the soap works. Even when he joined the Midland Railway Board, Mr Thomas used to do his day's work at the soap factory before travelling up to Derby in the evening for the meeting on the following day. Mr Charles Thomas presented to the Corporation a bust of his brother, Mr Christopher James Thomas, which had been executed the year after his death in 1894. The gift was received with appreciation as a remembrance of a valued citizen who had spent some of the best years of a long life in promoting the interests of the people of Bristol. In 1863 Mr Thomas went to the United States and travelled on the Union Pacific Railway as far as it was made on the East side. He watched with interest the construction of the railway and he was struck with the fact that four miles of road were laid down in one day between sunrise and sunset. Mr Thomas, within recent years, made a journey to Egypt, and, in fact, he had been in every capital in Europe except St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nRELIGIOUS SYMPATHIES\r\n\r\nMr Charles Thomas was a Unitarian, and if not the last, he must have been nearly the last of those worthy citizens who used to worship at Lewin's Mead Meeting before Oakfield Road Church existed. With the families of Castle, Coates, Worsley, Herapath, Brown, and Wansey, he and his brothers repaired to the spacious chapel, where they successively attended the ministrations of the Rev. George Armstrong, William James, and Ambrose N. Blatchford. He did not live to see the renovated meeting house, which will be re-opened on Sunday next by the rev. A. N. Blatchford. Although Mr Charles Thomas was a Unitarian, this fact did not prevent him subscribing to Church work, and especially was this the case with regard to the church in his native village of Llangadock. About twenty years ago this church was in a somewhat dilapidated condition, and Mr Thomas wrote to the Bishop of the Diocese pointing out the fact, and saying:'Unitarian as I am, I will give Â£50 towards its restoration'. That letter was the means of starting a fund, which was sufficient to practically rebuild the church. In addition to this subscription, Mr Thomas also presented one of the bells in the tower. Within the last year or two he had a good deal of correspondence with the vicar to start a little trust for keeping the churchyard in good repair. Mr Thomas was a liberal subscriber to the Bristol University College, the Royal Infirmary, and other institutions. At the last meeting of the subscribers to the Bristol Eye Hospital he took part in the proceedings, and the records of several societies which have for their objects the claims of the poor and suffering found in him a hearty supporter. He showed his appreciation of the Convalescent Home by becoming a governor of the institution. Mr Thomas's long life had been one of ceaseless activity, and when asked to tell younger men how to succeed in business he would say, 'By steady application to work, and by a determination to surmount obstacles, no matter how difficult'. Work had been Mr Thomas's pleasure, and, although he was fond of certain branches of sport, particularly hunting, he never allowed his recreation to interfere with his business.",
07/10/1908,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Sir Robert Henry Symes,"DEATH OF SIR ROBERT SYMES\r\n\r\nIt is with sincere regret, which will be shared by the citizens generally, that we announce the somewhat sudden death at his residence, Burfield, Westbury-on-Trym, in his 71st year, of Alderman Sir Robert Henry Symes, who for many years occupied a prominent position in Bristol. Sir Robert Symes was in his garden on Monday morning, but in the afternoon he was seized with an attack of angina pectoris. Dr J. O. Symes, of Pembroke Road, was called in, and remained with Sir Robert for some hours, but death ensued shortly after half-past three yesterday morning.\r\nThe late alderman was well known in business and social circles of the city, and was a familiar figure in the Commercial Rooms. His geniality and courtesy were marked and no frequenter of the Rooms could have been a more general favourite.\r\nAld. Symes was the fifth citizen of Bristol since 1850, who, having filled the office of Mayor, had the honour of knighthood conferred upon him by her late Majesty. In 1851 Mr John Kerle Haberfield was knighted, in 1887 Alderman George Edwards, and later on Alderman Chas. Wathen and Sir Joseph D. Weston. Alderman Symes was descended from a family that in the 16th century filled a leading position in the town of Chard, in Somersetshire, and who removed thence in the year 1593 to Poundisford Park, Pitminster, near Taunton. Born in Bristol in the year 1837, he was educated at the Independent College at Taunton, when the Rev. Dr. Bewglass was the headmaster, and at an early age became associated with the important provision business founded by his father, Mr H. J. Symes, in Temple Street. In 1861 his father took him into partnership under the style of H. J,. Symes and Son, and, on the head of the firm retiring in 1866 to reside at Yatton, the business, which proved a successful one, was carried on by Mr Symes in the name of Symes and Company. For some years Mr Symes conducted the business of provision merchant in Victoria Street. A few years ago this business was united with that of Messrs Pullin, Thomas and Slade, Limited, and the deceased became a director of the company. The late Alderman in his childhood resided in Temple Street, and had been many times churchwarden of Temple Church during the last 25 years. Upon accepting the Mayoralty he became the first co-opted guardian elected by the Bristol Incorporation of the Poor. One amongst many of the results of the deceased's long connection with Temple parish was that by which, with the cooperation of the Rev. W. Hazledine, the vicar, he was instrumental in getting five public-houses of bad character closed. The vestry, who were the owners of the houses, were persuaded by the Vicar and the deceased to give the tenants notice to quit, and the premises were converted into ordinary business houses. The superintendent of police in charge of the district at the time stated that this act was equivalent to saving the work of twelve constables. While comparatively speaking a young man, the deceased took the initiative step which ultimately led to the freeing of the toll bridges in St. Philip's and Prince Street - no small boon to a large number of the poorer citizens. He also took a leading part in forming the West of England Merchant's Association, the existence of which was almost was almost necessitated by the alteration in the Bankruptcy Acts; and for many years he held the post of chairman of this important association. Mr Symes also took an active interest in the movement so enthusiastically led by Mr Samuel Plimsoll, one of the members of Parliament at the time for Derby, which resulted in legislation, which was so much needed, to prevent overloaded and unseaworthy ships putting to sea.\r\nIn 1862 the deceased married Miss Davey, daughter of the late Mr Joseph Davey, of The Lawn, Taunton, by whom he had four children; his son, Capt. H. A. Symes, of the 4th Royal Dublin Fusiliers, and formerly of the Bristol Rifles, being the only one now living. His first wife died in 1878, and he married the eldest daughter of the late Mr John Kempe, of Long Ashton, in 1880, she then being the widow of Monsieur Hurlin, Capitaine au 5 ieme Bataillon de Chasseurs a pied, who served in the Franco-Prussian war and died in Corsica from injuries received in the war.\r\nIn 1882 the deceased was appointed one of the Lord Bishop's Commissioners for Church Extension in Bristol, and again at a subsequently appointed Commission for the same important work, he was one of the very earnest members, as he also was of the Bristol Bishopric Society, whose efforts were successful in raising the large amount required to fulfil the conditions of the Act of Parliament sanctioning the restoration of the Ancient See of Bristol.\r\nIn 1887 Mr Symes was elected Sheriff of Bristol. He laid the foundation stone of the Civic Cross in College Green. During the time he held office he took a prominent part, in conjunction with Sir Charles Wathen, who was then Mayor, in entertaining the late Prince Albert Victor on the occasion of his visit to the city to unveil the Queen's statue in College Green and to honour the Mayor and citizens by signing the Freeman's Roll. Two years afterwards Mr Symes became a justice of the peace, and was one of the most regular in attendance on the bench at the Bristol police court. In 1893 Mr Symes broke the spell of the popular tradition 'Once a Sheriff, never a Mayor', and found himself in the position of being chosen Mayor whilst not a member of the Council. Many important engagements were fulfilled during his first year of office. In January, 1894, he entertained Lord Roberts of Canahar and a distinguished party of noblemen and gentlemen at the Mansion House on the occasion of his being admitted a Freeman. In August, 1894, in conjunction with the Mayoress, he gave a ball at Colston Hall in honour of the visit to Bristol of the British Medical Association, when about 2000 visitors attended. The Mayor and Mayoress during the same month held a reception in honour of the visit of the Incorporated Law Society to Bristol, and at the end of October he had the pleasing duty of entertaining a no-less distinguished guest than Lord Rosebery, then Prime Minister of England, when he was presented with the freedom of the city, upon the occasion of his unveiling the statue of the renowned Edmund Burke in Colston Avenue. It was during the winter of his second year of office that Mr Symes made a special appeal for the unemployed and those in distress in consequence of the severity of the weather, and it is worthy of note that within three weeks a hearty response came from the public in subscriptions amounting to Â£5000.\r\nIn May 1895, he entertained at luncheon at the Council House the late Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Benson, when that prelate visited this city on the occasion of the completion of the choir of the cathedral.\r\nThe deceased, in January 1897, opened an Indian Famine Fund, by which Â£60,000 was raised, and he also opened a Jubilee Rejoicing Fund and a Jubilee Memorial Fund, which resulted in the handsome sum of Â£82,000 being raised towards the establishment and endowment of a Convalescent Home. On the 23rd June of the same year Sir Robert was presented to her Majesty at Buckingham Palace, and he was the recipient of the Jubilee Commemoration Medal. He also entertained Lord Dufferin on the occasion of that distinguished statesman visiting Bristol for the purpose of laying the foundation stone of the Cabot Memorial on Brandon Hill. Mr Symes after being four times Mayor, received the honour of knighthood from Queen Victoria, at Osborne House, in January 1898. At the Theatre Royal, King Street, during the progress of the pantomime 'Aladdin', Mr Ernest Carpenter made the announcement that her Majesty the Queen had been pleased to confer the honour of knighthood upon Bristol's Mayor, Mr R. H. Symes. The announcement was received with prolonged applause. Sir Robert, after being knighted, was twice elected to the post of chief magistrate, viz., in 1902 and 1903, so that for six years he filled the civic chair. He held a commission as honorary lieutenant in the disbanded Royal Naval Artillery Volunteer force, and retained the rank of lieutenant in the Navy. At his residence, Burfield, he frequently aided charitable objects by allowing fetes to be held in the grounds. Rejoicings in respect to Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and the Coronation of King Edward VII caused a large number of persons to assemble in the grounds.",

His death had been anticipated from the nature of his disease, and at the time he expired members of his family were present.\r\nAlthough the deceased gentleman of late years was little occupied in public affairs, he had, during the course of a busy life, been concerned with public questions, which he regarded from the standpoint of a staunch Liberal in politics. He was born at Edgbaston, June 6th, 1832, and his father, Mr John Henry Townsend, came to reside in Bristol after carrying on businesses in Birmingham and Leeds. The elder Mr Townsend joined the firm of Ferris and Score, chemists and druggists, Union Street, and he became a partner. Charles was educated in a school kept by Mr Daniell, in St. Paul's, where Mr E. G. Clarke and some others who obtained prominence in Bristol were trained. After leaving this educational establishment he entered the business of the Union Street firm. He had for many years the management of the wholesale and export department, previous to this appointment having represented the firm as a traveller over the West of England and South Wales. Through the activity and tact of the deceased the business became extended, and he was admitted a partner with others, so that the members were Messrs Ferris, Boorne, Townsend, and Boucher, and traded as Ferris and Co. With his father, mother, sister, and brother, Mr Charles Townsend was a regular attendant at Broadmead Baptist Chapel, which, during the early years of the pastorate of the Rev. N. Haycroft, was the religious home of many leading families among the Nonconformists, including those of Sperring, Mercer, Phillips, Tribe, Ransford, Daniell, and Dr Chandler.\r\n\r\nACTIVITY IN CIVIC AFFAIRS\r\n\r\nThe political career of Mr Charles Townsend may be said to have commenced when he succeeded Mr E. G. Clarke as chairman of the Liberals in the District Ward. He early won the esteem of his fellow citizens, and was cordially regarded by his political adherents, since he was not only thoroughly in earnest respecting politics, but he had a frank, manly bearing, which caused him to be esteemed by political opponents. He stepped out of the rank and file of the Liberal party to become a representative of the District Ward in the City Council. He was elected originally as councillor in 1872, and retained his seat till 1892, being returned at each election without opposition. On September 23rd, 1893, at a meeting of the District Ward Liberals he was presented with his portrait and an illuminated address in recognition of his having so long represented the ward in the Municipal Council. During the time he was in the Council the question of dockisation cropped up very strongly. Schemes of dock development had for some years been under discussion, and the matter of port improvement reached a stage when a section of the public pressed strongly that if a large enterprise was to be taken in hand it should assume the shape of dockisation of the Avon. The Council appointed a sub-committee to go into the subject, and Mr Charles Townsend became chairman of that committee. After considerable inquiry he explained to a meeting convened in the District Ward the features of a scheme of dockisation. He, however, was convinced that the cost of dealing with floods and sewage which would be part of any proposal was a 'dead' expenditure, quite unproductive, and it practically put the scheme out of court. Financial grounds, much as he approved of dockisation, induced him to abandon the scheme. His argument was freely used in the controversy that followed.\r\nMr Townsend upon one occasion figured in a Council meeting which had some singular features. He proposed a resolution that a special committee composed of members from both sides of the house should select the Mayor and Sheriff. The resolution was seconded by another Liberal councillor, and a solemn silence then prevailed the assembly. The Town Clerk appeared to hesitate in putting the motion, so significant seemed the calm; but at length two or three Liberal members who did not relish this unspeakable happiness taunted the Conservative members of the Corporation with having nothing to say in support of the method of election which had hitherto prevailed. Still no sign was made by the supporters of the 'Warwick Committee', who, however, when the time for voting came showed that they could present a solid phalanx in opposition to any alteration, and the result was 'as you were'. Since then, however, a different policy has prevailed in respect to the selection of the Lord mayor and Sheriff. In conjunction with Mr Sholto Vere Hare, Mr Townsend was elected one of the first two Governors of the Grammar School to represent the Council under the scheme of the Endowed Schools Commissioners, and he acted upon the governing body for six years. When his term of office expired, he retired in favour of Sir Charles Wathen. He was a member of the Sanitary Committee for about ten years, and he retired in order to give the seat to Mr John Bastow. Mr Townsend was also on the Libraries Committee when the public libraries were started, and he distinguished himself by great activity and intellectual vigour. His name was many years ago added to the list of those in the commission of the peace for the city.\r\nThe connection of Mr Townsend with Broadmead Chapel has been noted, and some time after he ceased to attend that place of worship he delivered an interesting address, in which he gave particulars of the Sunday School. He was on the committee for the erection of Tyndale Chapel, White Ladies Road, built to accommodate those Baptists who resided in the western suburb; and from the time when the Rev. Dr. Glover became the first pastor in 1869 Mr Townsend was a deacon of the church. He had been President of the Bristol Baptist Association, and for a long time was one of the honorary secretaries of the Bristol City Mission Society.\r\n\r\nAS THE ARDENT LIBERAL POLITICIAN\r\n\r\nTo the majority of Bristol citizens Mr Townsend was chiefly known in connection with Imperial politics. The old Liberal Registration Association underwent a change in 1884, when the distribution of Bristol into four divisions took place, and Mr Townsend, who was president, had with his colleagues to settle the new constitution. A representative committee, open to all sections of the party, was given to each of the four divisions. So highly was Mr Townsend esteemed by the Liberal party in the city that when a candidate for Bristol North was selected his name found most favour, although the other name was that of so popular a citizen as Sir Joseph D. Weston. A meeting of the Executive Committee was convened at the Ward Hall, Montpelier, Mr J. Coulthard presiding; and a division taken, with the result that eleven votes were recorded for Weston and 34 for Townsend. The Liberal Association of the division ratified the choice, and Mr Charles Townsend became M.P. from 1892 to 1895. Elected a member of the Executive Committee of the National Liberal Federation, he proved himself so efficient that he had the opportunity of being nominated for a seat in Parliament some time before he was chosen to contest Bristol North. Here he was opposed to Mr Lewis Fry, and was returned by 4,409 votes against his opponent's 4,084. In 1895 Mr Fry regained the seat, polling 4,702 to Mr Townsend's 4,464. In 1897 Mr Townsend was elected an alderman of the Council. Besides the important work which he did in Parliament and as a member of the Corporation, he became president of the Bristol Chamber of Commerce in 1874. He was the first president of the chamber after its incorporation that year, when the office of honorary president was abolished to others who became elected by the members. He was president of the Anchor Society in 1883, his collection being Â£948.\r\nMr Townsend married a daughter of Mr Adam Holden (Holden and Vining), the original proprietors of the Sugar Refinery, which was afterwards the property of Mr Finzel. He leaves two sons, Mr Henry Holden Townsend, of Larnaco, the Sea Walls, and Mr C. Kenyon Townsend, Hillmorton, Sneyd Park. His daughter, Miss Townsend, a member of the Bristol Education Committee, is well known as an energetic supporter of many philanthropic movements.",
20/11/1908,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Samuel Chappell,"DEATH OF MR SAMUEL CHAPPELL\r\n\r\nIt will be learnt with regret that Mr Samuel Chappell died at his residence, Fairlawn, Redland Road, yesterday morning, at the age of 84. As secretary to the Bristol Wagon Works Company and the Great Western Cotton Works Company, Mr Chappell was very well-known in commercial circles, and for his integrity of character, his unvarying courtesy, and geniality of manner he was generally highly respected. The deceased gentleman, however, was more widely known for his great practical interest in Sunday school and religious work, and his death will be deeply deplored, especially by the officers and members of Stapleton Road Chapel and Sunday schools. Since the foundation of that place of worship, in 1867, Mr Chappell had been so closely associated with it that to name one was to think of the  other; and though for some years past ill-health had prevented Mr Chappell's more active co-operation in the work of the church and Sunday schools, yet the sense of his total disseverance from it will be a fact hard to realise, and must prove a severe loss in the life of the church. Long before the foundation of the church at Stapleton Road Mr Chappell was actively associated with Castle Green Chapel, as an officer of the church, and as superintendent of the Sunday school, to which post he was appointed in 1840. In 1867 some 24 teachers and members left Castle Green with the object of founding a new church, and eventually the old workhouse in Pennywell Road was taken, and the new church commenced in January 1867. In March, 1868, ground had  been secured and a schoolroom built on the Goodhind estate, and in October 1871, the chapel was completed and opened. In these arduous labours Mr Chappell, with the hearty co-operation of his colleagues on the diaconate, had shared, and in all the active operations of the church until a few years ago. A year ago he was made a life deacon of the church.\r\nPerhaps there was no better known Sunday school worker in Bristol than Mr Chappell. As has been said, in 1840 he became superintendent at Castle Green: on the new Stapleton Road Church being formed, he was appointed superintendent of the school established in connection with it, and yearly since that time he has been re-appointed with, in the last 17 years, assistant superintendents to help in the more active operations, the school being then being very large. During his active connection with the Sunday school, Mr Chappell's personality was very marked, and his cheery face and kind and loving word were ever welcome and prized by those with whom he came in contact. In 1890 Mr Chappell was elected president of the Bristol Sunday School Union, and in the following year was re-appointed to the position. In 1900 he attained his diamond jubilee of Sunday school service, when two celebrations of the event took place, one being a gathering of old scholars, and the other of those then in the school. For the former, 1,470 invitations had been issued, and besides those present there were received 263 letters in response conveying congratulations from various parts of the world. Replies came from the then Lord Mayor (Sir H. Ashman), Sir W. H. Wills (Lord Winterstoke), Mr Lewis Fry, then representing the city in Parliament, the late Mr Mark Whitwill, the Rev. Arnold Thomas, Mr F. F. Belsey (chairman of council of the London Sunday School Union), and many other ministers and friends, and there was presented to Mr Chappell a large framed photograph of the officers and teachers of Stapleton Road School and its branch at Brick Street. The chairman of the meeting was Mr J. Storrs Fry. Mr Chappell was the first Sunday School worker in Bristol to receive the diploma of honour granted by the London Sunday School Union for long and distinguished Sunday school service, the presentation being made to him in 1901. For the last few years Mr Chappell's presence in the church and Sunday school has been compulsorily rare, but even in his physical weakness he was able to do much in relation to the affairs of the church and schools, and sent many a kind message and token of interest in the members and scholars.",
22/06/1907,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Henry Pethick,"DEATH OF HENRY PETHICK, J.P.\r\n\r\nThe death occurred near midnight on Thursday, at his residence, Trewartha, Weston-super-Mare, of Mr Henry Pethick, J.P., one of Weston's oldest magistrates and a gentleman highly esteemed in the town of his adoption. The deceased was a son of the late Mr Thomas Pethick, of Bristol, and was formerly a partner in the Bristol, Plymouth, Exeter, and London South American importing house of Haycroft and Pethick. He retired, however, many years ago, and settled down in Weston-super-Mare, where he proved a most estimable citizen. For some years he served on the old Town Commissioners, finance being his forte. Possessed of keen debating powers and quick to grasp the strong and the weak points of any scheme brought forward for consideration, he exercised a weighty influence, for which the town will long be indebted to him. In his judicial capacity as a magistrate he was most painstaking, and always endeavoured to temper justice with mercy. Behind a somewhat brusque manner existed a warm and loving heart, and in many instances he manifested a kindly interest in prisoners who were embarking on a life of crime. Well versed in the legal aspect of most cases, his loss to the bench will be a severe one. In many other directions deceased served his day and generation well and wisely, and the Y.M.C.A. has lost a generous supporter, and one who, for a long sequence of years, took the keenest interest in the institution. The Men's Sunday Afternoon Bible Class, conducted for several years by Mr Henry Harrison, and the Chrysanthemum Society had his practical support, and, as the first president of the Chrysanthemum Society, he was invited to occupy the same office on the attainment of its majority last year, an honour he cordially accepted. He was also on the committee of the Horse Show and the defunct Horticultural Society. For a number of years he acted as churchwarden at Christ Church, and many philanthropic and religious movements had his warm sympathy, included among which we may mention the Charity Organisation Society. Politically he was a staunch supporter of the Liberal cause until the Home Rule cleavage in 1886, when he joined the ranks of the Liberal Unionists. To the intense satisfaction of the local leaders of the Liberal party, however, he returned to his old allegiance prior to the last general election. His charity was freely bestowed, but in such an unostentatious way that it was scarcely realised that he had such a benevolent disposition. Deceased was 66 years of age, and had been ailing for something like 12 months, but he was only confined to his house for a month or two. The funeral will take place at Arno's Vale Cemetery, where his brother was buried in November 1902, and where other members of his family have been laid to rest. For Mrs Pethick and the family of the deceased the greatest sympathy will be felt in their bereavement.",
19/08/1907,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr William Proctor Baker,"DEATH OF MR WM PROCTOR BAKER\r\n\r\nAN HONOURED CAREER\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death of Mr William Proctor Baker, who for many years was one of the most prominent citizens of Bristol. He had been unwell for some time, and was staying with Mrs Proctor Baker at the Hotel Metropole, London,  where on Saturday morning he passed away.  \r\nThe deceased gentleman was closely identified with the civic life of Bristol for nearly 40 years, during which time he occupied  a seat on the aldermanic bench, and was, in 1871, elected Mayor of the city. It was in July, 1889, that Mr Baker, on the death of Alderman Phippen, entered the Council as alderman, and such an enthusiastic interest did he take in connection with all municipal matters that he became the leader of the Conservative party in the Council, and was 'Father of the House' in 1893. He was a man of the soundest judgment and keen perception, and being also a lucid speaker, he always claimed the closest attention of his hearers. On important questions the Alderman was always looked to with confidence by his colleagues, and he never failed to put clearly before the Council anything he had in hand. He was one of those conscientious men trusted by all parties in the House, and his influence was, therefore, great; indeed, it may be said that few men have done more than the late Alderman to elevate the municipal life of the city.\r\n\r\nAS CIVIC RULER\r\n     \r\nThere were certain occasions upon which he was particularly prominent. When, about 20 years ago, negotiations were in progress for acquiring the Bristol Water Works, Alderman Proctor Baker took a very prominent part for the Council. There was considerable discussion in the city at the time, particularly in regard to the price to be paid for the undertaking, and ultimately, at a meeting of the Council, it was decided to take no further steps. The proceedings at this meeting, though very short, were almost dramatic, for the Town Clerk, at that time Mr William Brice, having read the notice on the agenda as to the subject for discussion, looked towards Alderman Proctor Baker as there was silence in the Council. The Alderman, noticing the meaning look, rose and said: 'I have nothing to say,' after which a further silence fell, as it was at once seen that the whole matter had dropped. Mr Christopher Thomas (who was a director of the company) then rose, and said he hoped the next time the city entered into negotiations with the company they would mean business.\r\n\r\nPORT IMPROVEMENT\r\n\r\nPerhaps on no subject in connection with municipal life did Alderman Proctor Baker take a keener interest than that of port improvements. He was a most able chairman of the Docks Committee, and in this capacity much devolved upon him. He made a careful study of the docks and all the problems connected with them, and he entered with all his energy into schemes for dock improvements. In the early nineties an improvement scheme was before the citizens, and the Alderman was then looked to for guidance. He had a thorough grasp of the matter, and this was shown not only by his speeches in the Council Chamber, but also in other parts of the city. It was at the Liberal Club on October 20th, 1898, that he delivered an important speech on port improvements, and it is interesting at this point to recall passages from that speech. At that time the Alderman thought the city was not ripe for the larger scheme, which is just now being completed, but he strongly advocated progress at the mouth of the river. Introducing his speech at the Liberal Club, he said:- 'Now it is a matter of history that for the last few years men's minds in Bristol have been very full of larger schemes, very much larger schemes, than the present one. I refer, of course, to the plans that were put out and adopted for the building of a great dock at Avonmouth, adapted to take not only the largest steamers afloat, but larger steamers than any that were afloat, and the enthusiasm and acceptance which that scheme met with were surprising, notwithstanding that it involved an enormous outlay of money. There was also the other plan which has occupied men's minds, and for which there was an immense amount of enthusiasm. I refer to the scheme for dockising the river, which seems to have a particular attraction for many minds. But I am not going on this occasion to discuss in detail either of these schemes. I am not going to give you my own opinion upon them, because it is clear that for the present both of them are in abeyance, and no sane man would, I think, venture to recommend schemes the initial cost of which to the ratepayers would mean something like 1s 6d in the Â£1 per annum. At any rate, I should not have the courage to put forward any such schemes. Nor are we concerned at this point to discuss them, except that I may state that the execution of the present project would be just as necessary if either of those two schemes - I refer to the big dock at Avonmouth, or the dockisation of the river - were carried out. But for the present I think we must dismiss those schemes as heroic, and, for the present, impracticable. I should, however, just at this point, like to note that in the scheme which we are now about to consider, every provision has been made in the agreement with the railway company for the alteration of the plans in case dockisation at any future time becomes an accomplished fact. (Voice: 'At the Corporation expense'). At the Corporation expense, naturally, and the expense would be - if dockisation were carried out - a mere flea-bite in comparison with the expense of the whole concern. And I may just mention, perhaps, one point for the information of this meeting, which is particularly encouraging at the present moment. Up to this time we have had no ships at Avonmouth at all approaching in capacity to the size which could be admitted and accommodated there, but within the last few weeks we have had an application from Messrs Elder, Dempster, and Co., who are running the Canadian line, and who are shipowners on a very large scale, trading to many parts of the world, for the accommodation of ships of larger size than can be taken in at Avonmouth; and I may state, merely  as a matter of information, that if certain alterations can be made at Avonmouth, they are willing to undertake to run those ships with the same regularity that they are now running  their smaller vessels, and they believe that they can see their way to the employment of these larger vessels, constantly during the Canadian season. Our Engineer has made a device by which the lock can obtain the necessary enlargement at a comparatively small cost - a cost which I do not think the Council would hesitate for one moment to sanction. There are difficulties, however, in the way. There are difficulties peculiar to Avonmouth, and until we have had the very best advice upon the matter, that of Mr Wolfe Barry, to whom it has been referred, we cannot go on with it; but i hope that in the course of a very short time we shall be able to announce that the works are intended to be carried out. Now I think it will be acknowledged that there is a certain restlessness - may I say accompanied with a certain anxiety for the executing of new works! - a sort of feeling that has existed in some shape since the purchase of the river-mouth docks, and their alteration and equipment. And I think that that feeling arises from the latent fallacy - for it is a fallacy - that the mere extension of docks will create new and fresh trade. This is true only in a very limited sense. It is really the demand for commodities that increase trade; it is the increase in population which creates trade; it is not the mere execution of docks, that will create a business to them.'\r\nAlderman Proctor Baker was sincere in his desire to see a development of the port, and it was with a great interest he watched the progress of the Royal Edward Dock at Avonmouth, the completion of which, unfortunately, he has not survived to see.\r\n\r\nPUBLIC SERVICES\r\n\r\nIn November, 1901, the deceased retired from the Council. He had for a time lived at Broomwell House, Brislington, and afterwards he removed to Sandhill Park, about six miles from Taunton. It was while residing at Brislington that he was chosen Mayor for the city of Bristol, and during his Mayoralty in 1871-72 the capstone on the spire of St. Mary Redcliff Church was fixed. A good deal of excitement was caused by the Mayor, accompanied by the Mayoress, ascending the spire. Mr Baker had had a long connection with Redcliff, and was one of the most popular men in the parish, and on his part he was ever ready and willing to help on any movement there. Although going to live in Somerset, his interest in the old city did not cease, and up to the time of his death his connection with some of the institutions of Bristol was maintained. He was one of the most prominent and influential supporters of the General Hospital and the intelligence of his death was received with deep regret at the institution of which he was elected President, in succession to the late Mr Geo. Thomas, in 1872, and continued to hold the office until June last, when he resigned, on account of failing health. He took a deep and active interest in the work of the Hospital, and was instrumental in promoting many important enlargements. His death  will be much felt by those who were associated with him in the management of the Hospital, as well as by all the member  of the staff. He also continued to take the keenest interest in the Bristol Grammar School where (under the headmastership of Dr. Hudson), with his brother Arthur, he was educated, and on the occasion of the farewell dinner which was given to the Rev. J. W. Caldicott, when he retired from the headmastership, the deceased took a prominent part in the function. In 1875 Alderman Proctor Baker was placed on the Commission of the Peace, and during his closer connection with Bristol he frequently occupied a seat on the magisterial bench at the police court in Bridewell Street, and there again his judgment was always sound. He was Master of the Merchant Venturers in 1889, and his interest in education gained for him a seat on the old Bristol School Board in 1871, which he continued to occupy until 1890.\r\n\r\nAS EDUCATIONIST\r\n\r\nHis connection with the Merchant Venturers led Mr Proctor Baker to take more than ordinary interest in their Technical College. He contended, in some letters which he contributed to the local press, that parents ought to keep their sons longer at school, for education was the demand of the times. When this correspondence took place the value of the technical instruction afforded at the establishment in Unity Street was not appreciated to the extent it is at present. The letters in the newspapers on the subject of school years was by no means onesided, for some citizens crossed swords with Ald. Proctor Baker, and the result was an interesting mass of correspondence. The Colston School, Stapleton, and the Colston Girls' School in Cheltenham Road, both under the control of the Merchant Venturers, found in him a genial patron, and he was invariably at his best when presiding at the presentations of prizes in these scholastic establishments.\r\n\r\nAS MUSICAL AMATEUR\r\n\r\nAlthough the deceased gentleman's abilities in many directions were generally recognised, it will surprise a great number of persons who only came in contact with him during the Council part of his career, to know that he possessed, for an amateur, great knowledge as a musician. He was chairman of the first Musical Festival in Bristol, in 1873, and so successful was the gathering that at the close of the function he said, at a meeting of the committee, he was the very happy chairman of a very happy committee. In a communication respecting music, Mr Proctor Baker referred to himself as a somewhat enthusiastic amateur and a violoncello player. Indeed, he played in the band at the first Handel Festival at the Crystal Palace. He was a particular friend of Mr Henry Blagrove, the eminent violinist, and in reference to some particulars which appeared in the Musical Notes of the 'Western daily Press' seven years since, furnished particulars of a Bristol society to which Mr Blagrove lent valuable assistance. Nearly 50 years ago the Philharmonic Society was constituted in Bristol, and the committee consisted of Mr G. W. Edwards (his brother-in-law), Mr J. H. Hirst (architect), Mr A. King, and Mr W. Proctor Baker (who acted as honorary secretary). A band of about 50 performers was organised, Mr Henry Blagrove being the background of the organisation. He acted as conductor, and his patience and assiduity in training the executants were conspicuous. Through his exertions the amateurs were enabled to render orchestral compositions with considerable credit. Throughout he appeared actuated solely by a love of art, for in the matter of stipend he accepted very little more than sufficient to pay his travelling expenses.\r\nIn a MS report of the society drawn up by Mr Proctor Baker for the year 1858-9, it was stated when the preliminary meeting was held Mr Blagrove was staying in Clifton, and the gentlemen who had taken upon themselves the duties of the direction arranged with him to attend the remaining meetings. To cover the expenses of the practices a plan was adopted of admitting non-performers at half the subscription paid by performers. The accession to the subscription list under this arrangement was very considerable, and the series of meetings closed with a balance in hand. The preliminary gatherings aroused so much interest that on the 16th October, 1858, at a meeting held at the Victoria Rooms, Mr Thomas Proctor Jose in the chair, the Philharmonic Society was established, with Mr G. W. Edwards treasurer. At a concert given on the 18th April, 1859, Miss Jane Jackson (Mrs Roeckel), who was attending as an auditor, played a pianoforte solo as well as the accompaniment to a song given by Mr Fripp. In the concluding paragraph of the report written by Mr Proctor Baker occurs a paragraph recognising the pecuniary sacrifice made by Mr Blagrove. There were two concerts, in the arrangements of which Mr Proctor Baker and Mr Blagrove laboured assiduously, on 4th May, 1859, at the Victoria Rooms, constituting the Bristol Handel Centenary Commemoration, and intended to augment the funds for the restoration of Redcliff Church. Mr Blagrove's name appears as leader of the band; but he was much more than this, since he carried out all the arrangements with the principal vocalists, professional members of the band etc. The list of patrons contains, among others, the president of the Canynge Society and the president of the Redcliff Church Restoration Committee.\r\n\r\nAS MERCHANT\r\n\r\nThe deceased had from a comparatively early age been connected with the corn trade of Bristol. His father, Mr William Baker, founded the business now carried on by Messrs Spillers and Baker between 50 and 60 years ago, and at an early age Mr Proctor Baker was connected with the undertaking. In spite of a fire, the business was extended about 10 years after it was started, and in 1889 came the amalgamation with Messrs Spillers, of Cardiff. When that was accomplished, Mr Proctor Baker retired from business. He was a thoroughly keen and clever business man and was the pioneer of the rolling system of milling in this part of the world. Mr Proctor Baker married the daughter of the Rev. William Scott, vicar of St. Olave, Old Jewry, London, and editor of the 'Saturday Review'. Her brother was Mr Clement William Scott, the dramatic critic. When, some years ago, his comedy of humble life, 'Off the Line', with Toole in the principal part, was presented at the Prince's Theatre, no wonder that two of the most interested occupants of the orchestra stalls were Mr and Mrs Proctor Baker. Their daughter some time ago married to the Rev.

14/10/1907,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Rev. Philip Ashby Phelps,"DEATH OF THE REV. P. A. PHELPS\r\n\r\nWe deeply regret to announce the death of the Rev. Philip Ashby Phelps, at his residence, 29, Berkeley Square, Clifton. The deceased clergyman, who was rector of St. John's with St. Lawrence, was a member of a well-known Wiltshire family. Born in Wiltshire, he was educated at Marlborough College, afterwards was exhibitioner at Queen's College, Oxford, where he took a double second class in Moderations, third class in Lit. Hum, and honorary fourth in mathematics. He obtained his B.A. degree in 1863, and was M.A. in 1865. In the same year he was ordained by the Bishop of Bath and Wells, and received priest's orders in 1867. On leaving Oxford he became assistant master of King's School, Canterbury, after which he was for twenty-one years assistant master at Clifton College. He received the appointment of curate of St. James's, Clifton, 1868; and was curate of Emmanuel Church, Clifton from 1869 to 1885. In 1876 he was chosen chaplain to the Mayor of Bristol (Sir G. W. Edwards), and since 1885 he was rector of St. John the Baptist with St. Lawrence. He was very popular in the city, and connected with several undertakings which had for their object the improvement of the working classes. Among other bodies with which he was associated was the Committee for Promoting the Better Housing of the Poor, and as chairman of that committee he did a great deal of useful work. He assisted in the promotion and extension of evening classes for domestic economy and kindred subjects. As honorary clerical secretary of the Bristol Scripture Readers' Association and the Bristol Clerical Education Society he was a familiar figure on the platforms. The deceased took a keen interest in athletic and musical affairs, and while at Clifton College he became popular through the manner in which he furthered any object which conduced to the well-being of the pupils. His musical talent was generally admitted, and while Mr W. F. Trimnell remained music master at the College the Rev. P A. Phelps at the breaking-up concert was one who took part in the masters' quartet. He was a member both of the Bristol Madrigal Society and the Bristol Royal Orpheus Glee Society, and greatly enjoyed taking his share in the vocal efforts of these choirs upon the occasion of their Ladies' Nights. As clergyman of a parish in one of the busiest parts of the city he was most devoted to his duties, and the schools were his especial care, as might be expected from the ardour with which he pursued his labours while at Clifton College. He had been laid aside from his parish work for about three months.\r\nYesterday morning, preaching at the Church of St. John the Baptist, the Rev. Edward Mortimer (vicar of St. Michael and All Angels) made a feeling reference to the deceased, of whom he had been a great friend. At the close of the service the Dead March in 'Saul' was played on the organ.",
13/11/1907,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Charles Llewellin Thomas,"DEATH OF MR C. L. THOMAS\r\n\r\nThe death is announced of Mr Charles Llewellin Thomas, which event took place at his residence in Oakfield Road, Clifton, on Monday evening. The deceased, who was a partner in the firm of Messrs L. Thomas and Son, was widely known and respected. In earlier years he carried on an extensive business as builder at Portishead, and at that time superintended and successfully carried out several public and private buildings in that part of Somerset. In later years he has been associated in co-partnership with his brother, Mr W. K. Thomas, and, until laid low with illness, took a most active interest in the concerns of the firm, gaining and holding the confidence and respect of his numerous clients and workmen. In tangible proof the employees approached Mr C. L. Thomas a year or two ago, and presented a beautifully illuminated address. During his many years residence at Portishead the deceased gentleman actively identified himself with every movement that tended to the progress and prosperity of the village. He was an enthusiastic cricketer, and his play often spelt victory for his side. He was also an ardent Volunteer. He distinguished himself in the Mason Order, passing the presidential chairs in the Craft and Arch degrees and attaining Provincial Grand rank in each grade. Mr Thomas promoted many entertainments, and was one of the best reciters of the famous 'Agrikler' poems. The deceased will be remembered for his kindly disposition and his many acts of unostentatious charity. He was a firm Churchman and a staunch Conservative. Mr Thomas, who was only 53 years of age, succumbed to neuritis. He leaves a widow and a grown up family.",
21/09/1901,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Edward Halsall,"DEATH OF MR EDWARD HALSALL\r\n\r\nAN INTERESTING CAREER\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death, which took place early yesterday morning, of Mr Edward Halsall, who was well-known to many business men in the city as 'the Father of the Commercial Rooms'. Though in his hundredth year Mr Halsall as recently as Thursday week visited the rooms, and was then looking well and hearty, but on Sunday he became unwell, and from Tuesday until the time of his death was conscious most of the time, rallying occasionally to recognise the tender care of his wife, who was constantly in attendance upon him. Death occurred yesterday morning about four o'clock from heart failure and decay of nature. Mr Halsall was at one time a watchmaker in Bristol. He had, however, long since retired from business, and resided at No. 4, Somerset Street, Kingsdown. He occupied his ample leisure by attending to matters in connection with the committee of the General Hospital, from the meetings of which institution he was rarely absent; by scrutinising the affairs of many public companies in which he was a shareholder, and by gossip in the Commercial Rooms, of which he was long regarded as the father. That patriarchal phrase, indeed, was applied to him with singular appropriateness, since the 'Commercial Coffee Room', as it was at first intended to name the structure (though the word 'Coffee' was subsequently suppressed), was opened when the deceased had completed his eighth year. To the present generation of subscribers Mr Halsall was a familiar figure, invariably occupying a chair at one of the round tables near a fireplace, either reading a newspaper or joining in conservation with other elderly gentlemen, most of whom he outlived. It was interesting for those citizens who took a pleasure in contemplating the changes which successive improvements have brought about in Bristol to get the deceased to recall events long past. He remembered well the circumstances connected with the Riots in 1831, and took an active share in endeavouring to restore order during that turbulent epoch. He was sworn in as a special constable, and was the first member of the body then formed to enter Queen Square  during the orgies of the populace. He related how he saw numbers of the rioters drunk and helpless through the rich wines which they had wantonly consumed. The soldiers, he remarked, backed up the special constables, and he recollected the furniture after it had been taken out of the houses piled up in the Square in order that it might be removed. One celebrity among those he could recall was Madame Tussaud, who had her show of wax work figures in the Assembly Rooms, Prince Street, though she stayed only a limited time in Bristol, and used to go with her sons round the provinces with her exhibition before she settled in the metropolis. He had a distinct recollection of seeing the late Queen when, as Princess Victoria, then only eleven years of age, she visited Clifton, from Malvern with her mother, the Duchess of Kent, on October 19th, 1830. It was in the evening they arrived at Clifton at Burtt's or Long's Hotel, opposite the Mall. They were received by large numbers of people, who appeared delighted to see the Princess. The excitement was not great, but the spectators experienced much interest in the appearance of the Royal maiden, and at the hotel Sir John Coursy held lights before her, and the whole of the Mall was lighted with variegated lamps. Mr Halsall formed one of a number of business men who assisted in the formation of Bristol Stock Exchange. In the record of a special meeting of the Bristol Stock Exchange Association held on March 27th, 1845, Mr J. K. Haberfield (he had not then been knighted), president, and Mr Thomas Carlisle, vice-president, the name of Mr Edward Halsall appears, together with the names of John Chilcott, Henry Oldland, R. H. Webb, F. Barnard, W. H. Somerton, and others. As an active pedestrian Mr Halsall, until he was ninety years old, used to accomplish walks which few young men would care to take regularly, as he regarded ten miles an ordinary distance to cover in a day. He had secured the affectionate regard of all who were accustomed to meet him, especially in the Commercial Rooms, and when he was present there on attaining his 93rd birthday, he soon found himself surrounded by a group of friends who heartily congratulated him. One gentleman presented him with a bouquet of flowers which lay safeguarded on the table during the rest of his sitting as he read the news of the day from various journals. Mr Halsall had the honour of breakfasting many years ago with the Prince Consort and Queen Victoria at Balmoral, with some members of the British Association. He was greatly interested in various sciences, and had also travelled abroad a good deal.",
31/08/1901,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Dr Alfred Edward Aust Lawrence,"DEATH OF DR A. E. AUST LAWRENCE\r\n\r\nIt is with regret we record the death of Dr. Alfred Edward Aust Lawrence, of Richmond Hill, Clifton, which took place on Thursday with painful suddenness at Bishopsteignton, near Teignmouth, where the deceased gentleman, with his wife and family, had gone to spend his holiday. They left Clifton in the early part of August, and then, as well as up till Wednesday night, Dr Aust. Lawrence appeared to be enjoying his usual good health. He appeared to have made Bishopsteignton his headquarters, and moved about for various excursions. On Thursday morning he was found dead in bed, and the evidence offered at the inquest, held later in the day, revealed the fact that he had died from heart failure. The deceased gentleman was a son of the late Mr W. Scott Lawrence, of Stapleton, and was educated at Bristol and Aberdeen University, taking his degree of M.B., C.M., at the latter place in 1872, and his M.D. in 1874. In the following year he was appointed physician accoucheur at the Bristol General Hospital, but he resigned that position a year or two afterwards, when he was appointed consulting physician accoucheur. For many years he had been professor of midwifery and diseases of women at University College, Bristol, and held that appointment at the time of his death. In that capacity he lectured in the recent session of the College. Deceased had been president of the Bristol Medico-Chirurgical Society, and was at the time of his death president-elect of the Bath and Bristol branch of the British Medical Association. For several years, too, Dr Aust. Lawrence had been, and was at the time of his death, a vice-president of the Obstetrical Society of London, and he was a leading authority in his special subject in the whole of the West of England and South Wales district. He took part in the proceedings of his section at the late meeting of the British Medical Association at Cheltenham, and in 1894, when the association visited Bristol, he was also particularly active in connection with his special branch. It was mainly to obstetrics that the deceased gentleman devoted his studies and researches, and as a result he became author of numerous communications and papers, as well as medical writings on the subject. Dr Aust Lawrence was 53 years of age, and he leaves a widow and two daughters, for whom the deepest sympathy will be felt in their painfully sudden bereavement. Yesterday afternoon they returned from Teignmouth to Clifton, and late in the evening the remains of the deceased gentleman wee also brought up from Devonshire.",
03/08/1901,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Rev. James Eustace Brenan,"SUDDEN DEATH OF CANON BRENAN\r\n\r\nIt is with regret that we announce the sudden death of the Rev. James Eustace Brenan, honorary canon of Bristol Cathedral and vicar of Emmanuel Church, Clifton. Yesterday morning his son received a telegram that the rev. gentleman had died at Bergen, Norway, whither he had gone for a holiday. He preached at Emmanuel Church last Sunday morning, and it was noticed that he  delivered his sermon with unusual animation. On Tuesday he left Bristol, and seemed in good spirits, one of his two sons accompanying him. No doubt the sudden death of his wife on the 12th of May last year, when on a visit at Lsleworth, was deeply felt by him, but he appeared cheerful when he departed from this city, and said he looked forward to the change of scene with great pleasure. The intelligence of his decease will occasion the utmost grief to the members of his congregation, who were deeply attached to him, and the clergy will miss one who was an attached friend. Mr Brenan was the second vicar of Emmanuel, having succeeded the Rev. T. G. Lucock, to whom the living was given by the Simeon Trustees. The deceased was a student at Trinity College, Dublin. He became curate at Douglas, Cork, from 1859 to 1861; was curate at Harold's Cross, Dublin, from 1861 to 1864; incumbent of Albert Chapel, Dublin, from 1864 to 1869; was secretary of the Jews' Society from 1869 to 1873; and vicar of Christ Church, Ramsgate, from 1873 to 1892. In the latter year he became vicar of Emmanuel, Clifton, and in 1899 received the appointment of honorary canon of Bristol Cathedral. At Ramsgate he was much beloved, and Mrs Brenan did a great deal of useful work, taking an active part in the establishment of a house of rest. The same desire to benefit those around him was manifested by Mr Brenan when he removed to Clifton. He took much interest in the boys engaged in the smack fishery, and for some time acted as secretary of the Church Missionary Society, with his wife presenting Â£100 towards it funds. He was well supported in his church labours by the wardens, Mr G. H. Mead and Mr A. Balfour, and not long ago they were in communication with him respecting a memorial window to Mrs Brenan. A committee had been formed, and the subject of the window was discussed, one feature being children brought to Christ, highly appropriate as the window is to be placed in the baptistery near the font. The decease was about 65 years of age.",
19/03/1901,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Simon Short,"DEATH OF MR SIMON SHORT\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death, at his residence, Aldersyde, Horfield, of Mr Simon Short, who had for many years taken a prominent part in the temperance movement in Bristol. Mr Short, who was in his 76th year, was the son of a soldier who fought at Waterloo, and died when the boy was five. Born in Bristol in 1824, young Simon went to sea, and experienced bitter treatment from drunken sailors. It was in his 18th year that he heard a temperance address in Tailors' Hall, Broad  Street, from Mr Robert Charleton, and thereafter signed the pledge. At about the same time he came under deep religious conviction, the joint result of which was that three years later he undertook work in connection with the Bethel Ship. He served as Seamen's Missionary in this connection for thirty years, when he left for Liverpool. After a few years' absence he returned to  Bristol, and became  hon. superintendent of the mission, a post which failing health compelled him  to resign. In his early years he went to the sailors, and to the navvies at work upon the new  railways. He would climb the deck of a ship or mount a wagon in front of a public house, and with clarion voice proclaim the blessings of temperance and the truths of the Gospel. Sometimes he was thrown into the water or had his coat torn to shreds, but he fought on, and hundreds of men had  cause to bless the day they heard his voice. Even in those early years he had the practical idea of Temperance reform, and planted sheds on quays and near the railway cuttings in order to supply the workmen with hot and unintoxicating beverages. In 1862, the provision assumed more tangible shape by the opening of a coffee tavern in West Street. A cocoa boat was maintained in the Floating Harbour, and later a British Workman public-house was established. Subsequently  other refreshment-rooms were opened and managed successfully by Mr Short, and then his fame spread throughout England. Visitors came to examine the rooms and to learn the secret of their success. In the next decade Mr Robert Lockhart, a Liverpool merchant, had associated with him a number of friends whose capital enabled several cocoa rooms to be opened in the great seaport of the North. The promoters persuaded the committee of the Bethel Mission in Bristol to spare Mr Short for six weeks, to show them 'how to do it'. In 1875, therefore, he visited Liverpool, and the six weeks became two years; the number of houses increased to 36, and not only were real boons to the working population, but a source of profit to the directors of the company. In 1877 Mr Short and his sons accompanied Mr Lockhart to Newcastle-on-Tyne, where eleven  cocoa rooms were opened, and several of these are to be found in the best business centres catering at moderate charges, not only for the artisan class, but for clerks and business men and  women. From Newcastle Mr Short went to Bradford, where the system was established, and early in the eighties he returned to his native city. In High Street, Bristol, he took over a cocoa  tavern, which he conducted with satisfactory financial results to himself. On the walls of the large room on its first floor were several framed addresses presented to Mr Short. One bore date  September 26th, 1877, and was from the employees of the British Workman Public House Company. Another, dated June 20th, 1892, was presented to 'the Father of the Coffee Tavern Movement' from the National Coffee Tavern Association, of which he was president. On the same date, commemorating fifty years of total abstinence, was one from the Bristol Temperance Society, signed by its officers. Four years later (January 25th, 1896) a double jubilee was observed, that of fifty years' connection with the Bethel Mission, and his golden wedding. A handsome address, surmounted by a ship, was presented from the Bethel Committee. Besides the active services he rendered to the cause of temperance, Mr Short was useful as a member of the Bristol Board of Guardians. He also preached occasionally in the towns which he visited, his discourses being of an eminently practical character.",
21/01/1901,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr E. G. Clarke,"DEATH OF MR E. G. CLARKE\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death of Mr E. G. Clarke, the late Official Receiver for Bristol. Mr Clarke had been ill for several months, and just before Christmas his life was despaired of, but he rallied remarkably, and his condition was gradually improving until Thursday, when there was a relapse, and death took place on Saturday afternoon at one o'clock. Mr Clarke was born in Devonshire, but at a very early age came to Bristol. His father, Mr Gustvus Clarke, who lived to the patriarchal age of 89 years, resided for a long period with his son, having retired from business life many years, though he continued to the end of his existence to take a keen interest in public affairs, and in this respect Mr E. G. Clarke followed his example. The father was an ardent Liberal, and filled the office of chairman of the Liberal Association in the District Ward, being succeeded in this post by Mr Charles Townsend, between whom and Mr E. G. Clarke there were strong ties of friendship, indeed the deceased gentleman used frequently to say that Mr Townsend was one of his oldest companions. Mr E. G. Clarke was educated at Portland Square, at a private school kept by Mr Daniell, a member of a well-known family, who were staunch Nonconformists. The lad had for his schoolfellows Charles Townsend and Charles Hoskins Low, both of whom became aldermen of Bristol. In those days the houses in the two squares in St. Paul's and the immediate neighbourhood were tenanted by some leading citizens, the Willses, Ditchetts, and Sherrings amongst them, and young Clarke early became acquainted with them, and throughout his mature years he was an intimate friend of Sir William Henry Wills. He obtained a situation in the office of Messrs Barnard and Thomas, accountants, Albion Chambers, the firm afterwards known as Barnard, Thomas, Tribe, and Co., when Mr Wilberforce Tribe became a partner. Mr Clarke early manifested great ability, and his services in connection with the large and important business - for the firm acted as accountants to a large number of public companies and private individuals not merely in Bristol but throughout the West of England and South Wales - were so valued that in September, 1873, he became a partner, the other members of the firm then being Mr George Thomas and Mr Wilberforce Tribe.\r\nIt is not saying too much to state that Mr Clarke was soon known as pre-eminent among accountants and consequently no one felt surprised upon the failure of the West of England and South Wales District Bank, in September, 1878, that he should be appointed joint liquidator with Mr Turquand. The larger portion of the work arising out of the liquidation devolved upon Mr Clarke. The proceedings lasted a considerable time, and in August, 1879, the Home Secretary (Sir Richard Cross) ordered a prosecution to be instigated against the directors for issuing alleged fraudulent balance sheets. The trial took place in London, in April, 1880, at first at the Central Criminal Court, and subsequently, as a larger building seemed desirable, in the Court at the Guildhall. The evidence of Mr E. G. Clarke was the most important, as he had gone thoroughly through the accounts. He was in the witness-box for a long time, and the ready manner in which he afforded information upon different points that bore upon the issues excited admiration from the large number of business men assembled to listen to the proceedings. Mr Turquand was called more as a matter of form, since he admitted that most of the investigation had been carried on by the deceased. The Lord Chief justice (Sir Alexander Cockburn) complimented Mr Clarke upon his ability, and in truth he well deserved the praise bestowed. When his turn came to give evidence he was prepared with a multiplicity of necessary documents which he had carefully collated and arranged round the lower part of the witness-box so that he knew by their order where to select any paper asked for by the many members of the bar who appeared for the defendants. This trial was remarkable on account of an interview between the Judge and the witness. Mr Clarke did not divulge its nature till some years had elapsed. The Chief Justice, after Mr Clarke's long evidence was concluded, sent for him while the business of the court was proceeding, and in a low voice asked him if, in examining the affairs of the bank, he had come across any indications of fraud or falsification. Mr Clarke said he was fairly staggered at the question, and remarked, 'Is not that the issue being tried?'. 'Yes,' said his Lordship; 'But did you?' 'No,' was the response. 'I thought not,' said the Judge. It is a matter of history that at the close of summing up from the Chief Justice the jury speedily returned a verdict of acquittal. The incidents of the bank failure, and the interest awakened generally in the trail, led to a publisher offering Mr Clarke a substantial amount if he would write an account of the financial catastrophe. He, however, felt that to supply details of the event would cause pain to many persons, and declined the offer. There was a rather humorous feature in relation to his inquiry, from persons in all parts of the United Kingdom and likewise from aboard. The majority were strangers to him, and they had gathered from the sources of information they possessed scanty information even of his name, for he had one letter addressed to him as 'Albion Chambers, Esq', and another as 'E. G. Liquidator, Esq'.\r\nThe deceased not only was an excellent accountant, he took much interest in mercantile affairs in the city, and as a member of the Chamber of Commerce did much useful work. When the meeting of the Associated Chambers was held at Cardiff in September, 1873, he with Mr John Evans, Mr John Lucas, Mr Henry Taylor, Mr Leonard Bruton (secretary), and Mr H. J. Spear (assistant secretary), represented the Bristol Chamber. At the meeting a resolution was submitted by the Newcastle Chamber on the question of the advisability of using adhesive stamps on bills of exchange and bills of lading. Colonel E. S. Hill supported the resolution, and was followed by Mr E. G. Clarke. Subsequently Mr Clarke moved a resolution upon the evasion of the Bills of Sale Act. He considered that the practice of executing deeds of attornment by which a debtor gave a preferential security on his effects without the publicity of registration, thus practically evading the Bills of Sales Act, was prejudicial to the interests of trade; and that those deeds ought either to be declared illegal or made public by enforced registration. Mr Clarke referred to instances which had come under his own notice where the practice complained of had prevailed. He asked that some steps might be taken by the Executive to remedy grievances which the motion deprecated, and with a slight modification the resolution was carried. This meeting of the Associated Chambers was signalised through the action taken by Mr John Evans, of Bristol, on the load line, which was then a burning question on account of the statements of Mr Samuel Plimsoll.\r\nAmongst other useful work which the deceased accomplished was that as honorary secretary of the Anchor Society, a position he held for a long number of years. In 1877 he was invited to become president of that society, succeeding his friend Mr Samuel Lang. The deceased's collection amounted to Â£940, which was reckoned at that time a very substantial amount. Mr Clarke caused to be circulated amongst the company copies of a neat little pamphlet which he had compiled 'Concerning Edward Colston, of Bristol and London, merchant and his anniversary, with some facts and  figures'. In an introduction he admitted that not much could claim to be original beyond the idea and the arrangement, but feeling that the growth of the Colston Societies was not a matter of personal recollections to the increasing numbers who year by year attended the commemorations, and having held the office of honorary secretary to the Anchor Society for ten years, it occurred to him in the year of his presidency to put a few facts together about the man and about the societies which did honour to his memory. In his pamphlet Mr Clarke suggested that the Colston Societies might contribute to the University College, either for scholarships or to form the nucleus of a building fund, 'and if each society would set apart twenty per cent. of its available income this thing would be done, with yet sufficient left for charity, and be quite within the scope of Colston's own intentions'.\r\nWhen upwards of 15 years ago the operations of the Bankruptcy Act were changed and Official Receivers appointed, the deceased was given the important position of Official Receiver for the Bristol District, in which are included Bath, Frome, and Wells. He was eminently fitted for the duties, and entered upon his work in an office in the Bank Chambers, Corn Street, and afterwards in the building erected in Baldwin Street for the Inland revenue Department. This appointment necessitated his severing his connection with the firm in Albion Chambers, which had become Tribe, Clarke, and Co., a style still retained. The age limit in connection with his office had been reached, but so capable was he felt to be, and so popular was he in the city, that his term was twice renewed. A gratifying feature about the second extension in May last was that Mr Clarke's application was, entirely without his knowledge, supported by a petition from the public of Bristol, probably unique in its representative and spontaneous character. 'Your memorialists,' the signatories said to the Board of Trade, 'have known Mr Clarke long and intimately, and are able to testify that he has performed his work in the administration of the Bankruptcy Acts here for the past 16 years with the greatest ability, judgment, and fairness'. And they wound up with an expression of opinion that the retirement of so valuable an official would be detrimental to the interests of the public service.\r\nMr Clarke was heartily congratulated by his friends, and not unnaturally felt considerable gratification, both at the success of his application and at the remarkable display of good will on the part of the citizens. One feature in connection with his duties as Official Receiver deserves to be recorded. At the commencement of each year he prepared a careful digest of local bankruptcy work during the previous twelve months, a document not merely useful as affording information respecting the cases which were classified, but also containing suggestions of a valuable character. These particulars being published in extenso in the Bristol newspapers, were available to the trading community, whom they specially concerned, as well as the general public.\r\nIn recalling the public work which Mr Clarke undertook, we may mention the fact that he was secretary of the original Dockisation Association which was presided over by the late Mr Charles Hill. After that time he was a partner in the firm of accountants in the Albion Chambers, and he opened an office specially on the ground floor in the Chambers for the accommodation of the Dockisation Committee, who held several meetings in various wards, notably Clifton and Bedminster, at which the deceased was one of the principal speakers.\r\nThe efforts of the deceased, in conjunction with Mr J. W. Arrowsmith and Mr H. J. Spear, to promote the extensive Industrial Exhibition held on the open space near the Stone Bridge in 1893 and 1894 will be remembered. The same gentlemen were concerned in the management of the exhibitions at the Rifle Drill Hall in 1883 and 1887, besides being prominent in arranging for other displays in that building in more recent years. So many sided was Mr Clarke that there were few undertakings started in Bristol which had for their objet the benefit of the people that did not obtain his support and interest. He was chosen chairman of the County Ground Company when it was formed ten years ago, and he was president of many local athletic clubs, notably the Bristol Rugby. Healthy sport of all descriptions found in him a warm advocate. He was concerned in the management of the County of Gloucester Cricket Club, was partial to lacrosse, hockey, and lawn tennis, and identified with the Ariel Rowing Club. Eminently social in his disposition, he received numerous invitations to public dinners, where his neat and witty addresses always afforded pleasure. It is not too much to say that he was one of the most effective after-dinner speakers in the city. His powers as a singer were not great, but he possessed a keen delight in listening to musical performances, and hence became one of the committee of the Bristol Festival Society, and vice-president of the Society of Gleemen. One of his hobbies was to have the control of a newspaper, but here did not prove fortunate, though the experience gained enabled him to garnish some amusing speeches which he made at the annual dinners of  the Bristol and West of England Press Fund. He had long meditated inviting some of his many friends to meet him around the social board, and an opportunity offered on the completion of the new offices of the Official Receiver in Baldwin Street. The occasion when the gathering was held at St. Stephen's Restaurant, and Mr Clarke proved a most genial chairman, will not be forgotten by those who were bidden. The deceased had a seat on the directorate of the Zoological Gardens Company, and was a member of the committee of the Commercial Rooms. He had been twice married, and resided for many years at Woodside, Redland, subsequently removing to 9, Westfield Park.\r\nMr Clarke resigned his position of Official Receiver at the end of last year, and at the sitting of the court last week, his Honour Judge Austin, in welcoming the new Official Receiver, made an allusion to Mr Clarke, in the course of which he said:-\r\n'During his long service of, I think, 17 years, Mr Clarke won for himself the esteem and affection of all who were around him. He brought to the performance of his duties a great experience both of men and of figures, a ripe judgment, a kindly heart, and a pleasant manner, and it was no wonder, therefore, that he made a most popular Official Receiver, as well as a most efficient one.'",
15/12/1902,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr William Killigrew Wait,"DEATH OF MR W. K. WAIT\r\n\r\nThe long illness of Mr W. K. Wait terminated fatally on Saturday morning. That his condition was very serious had been realised, but on Friday evening there appeared no indication that the end was so near. Mr Wait, however, passed away at half-past nine on the following morning. Although to a younger generation the deceased gentleman was little more than a name, it is not so many years ago that he was one of the foremost of Bristol citizens in commercial, municipal, and political life. He was a son of the late Mr W. K. Wait, who was an alderman of the city, and sheriff, in 1837. He was born at Cote in December, 1826, educated at Bristol College, and entered the Bristol Council in 1867, was Mayor in 1869-70, and created an alderman in 1886, which office he held until 1891, when he resigned. He was president of the Dolphin Society in 1867, and was elected M.P. for Gloucester in 1873. A great deal of excitement prevailed in the city on the polling day, but it was felt by Mr Wait's supporters some time before the result was declared that he was the successful candidate, and his leading supporters, in spite of his protests, made him address the crowd from a window at the Bell Hotel. After the declaration of the poll the Conservative triumph seemed complete, and Mr Wait became highly popular, as he was re-elected in 1874, though he was unsuccessful at the contests in 1880 and 1885, after which he did not seek to be again elected  While he represented Gloucester he identified himself with the institutions, and acted as a steward at the Musical Festivals. \r\nMr Wait was one of the first supporters of the Children's Hospital, and in 1865, with Messrs Mark Whitwill, Augustus Phillips, and other philanthropic Bristolians, signed an appeal for subscriptions, the intention at first being to fit up a suitable house for the reception of a few patients, so that only Â£300 a year was asked for. The dwelling in the Royal Fort, however, ultimately developed into the present edifice in the Tudor style. The name of Mr Wait came prominently before the citizens in 1870, when (during his mayoralty) he offered to build the new north porch of the Cathedral, estimated to cost Â£1,200, provided a like sum was subscribed to raise the north wall of the nave for its reception. The required sum was soon forthcoming. The new north porch in 1876 led to a fierce controversy in the city. According to the architect's designs statues of the four great doctors of the Western Church - Gregory, Jerome, Ambrose, and Augustine were to adorn the portal, and the figures were executed at a cost of about Â£450, and they elevated to the niches constructed for them about the middle of February, 1876. They remained occasioning little remark for some days; but at length the local newspapers contained an assertion authorised by Canon Girdlestone that the statues had been erected without the consent of the Dean and Chapter; whereupon Mr Wait retorted that the plans, including the figures, were submitted to, and approved by the capitulator body in 1867. Subsequently Mr Wait admitted that this statement was stronger than the facts warranted. Dean Elliott, who was in Italy while the controversy was in its early stages, having returned to Bristol, presided at a chapter, and the majority decided that the Dean should take measures for the removal of the figures. As the committee appointed to carry out the restoration of the Cathedral intimated they would resist this step until the figures were declared illegal, some workmen were secretly engaged, and the statues removed, though not before they had been injured. The Dean informed Mr Wait that the Chapter had not sanctioned the subjects of the figures, and had taken the sketches in the design to represent the Evangelists, Mr Wait was associated with the well-known firm of Wait and James, corn merchants, etc., of this city and Gloucester. For  many years he took an active part both in the municipal and political life of the city, but since his health gave way, seven or eight years ago, he lived in comparative retirement. Mr Wait leaves four sons and two daughters. Mr H. W. K. Wait, his eldest son, has followed his father's example in showing an interest in municipal matters, and sits in the Council for the Central Ward.",
21/01/1902,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Vincent Stuckey,"DEATH OF MR VINCENT STUCKEY\r\n\r\nThe announcement of the death of Mr Vincent Stuckey, which occurred at his residence, Hill House, Langport, in the early hours of yesterday morning, will be received with universal regret by public men throughout the county of Somerset, and with much sorrow by his numerous personal friends. Not only in his native county, but throughout the West of England - and, indeed, wherever Stuckey's Bank is known - was his name revered; and his happy personality will long be remembered. For the last few years it had been no secret that Mr Stuckey had shown symptoms of weakness of the heart, and he gradually retired from his many public offices and from any active participation in public affairs. For nearly twelve months he had been confined to his residence, and was only seen by his relatives and immediate friends. His medical attendant, Dr Johnstone, of Langport, was summoned on the night of Friday, when he found his patient suffering from haemorrhage from the nose. He was unable to be removed from the sitting-room to his bedroom, and a temporary bed was made up, where he remained under the constant attendance of Dr. Johnstone, until he peacefully passed away at 1.50 yesterday morning. Mrs Stuckey and his eldest daughter (Mrs Pinney) were with him.\r\nBorn at Staplegrove, Somerset, in May, 1829, Mr Stuckey was, therefore, in his 73rd year. His father was one of the Somerset Woods, and his mother was Miss Stuckey, of Hill House, daughter of Mr Vincent Stuckey, the founder of Stuckey's Banking Company.\r\nOn the death of his grandmother in 1861, Mr Stuckey, in accordance with the wish of his grandfather, assumed the name of Stuckey, and came into possession of his grandfather's property. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, and afterwards travelled on the Continent. He joined Stuckey's Banking Company in 1851, soon becoming a director, and, with his cousin, the late Mr Walter Bagehot, had much to do with its management. In 1875, on the death of Mr Ambrose Lethbridge, he was unanimously elected chairman of the bank, which position he occupied until 1900, when he retired through ill-health, and was succeeded by Mr Hepry W. Hoskyns, of North Perrott. In 1865 Mr Stuckey married Mary, daughter of the Rev. Prowse Lethbridge, and granddaughter of Sir Thomas Lethbridge, of Sandhill Park, Somerset, who survives him. He leaves two daughters (his only children), the elder being married to Captain Pinney, son of Colonel Pinney, of Somerset Erleigh; and the other to Mr J. Gundrv, the Hyde, Bridport. The late Mr Stuckey was a J.P. and a D.L. for Somerset, for which county he served the office of High Sheriff in 1883. He remarkable interest in public affairs, and for many years he held the chairmanship of many public bodies, from several of which he only recently retired in consequence of the state of his health. Among other offices, he was for years chairman of the Somerset Drainage Commissioners, the Langport Drainage Board, the old Highway Board and the Board of Guardians of the Langport Union. He was also chairman of the Langport Town Trust, of the Board of Governors of the Langport Grammar School, and of the Langport and  Huish Episcopi Board of Schools. He was a member of the old Corporation of Langport (disestablished in 1883), under which he served the office of portreeve. The late Mr Stuckey took great and active interest in the volunteer movement in his native county. For 28 years he was in the West Somerset Yeomanry Cavalry, being for most part of that time captain commandant of the Langport and Somerset troop, retiring in 1879 with the rank of major, and permission to wear the uniform. At the same time he commanded the Langport company of Volunteer Rifles. Being a popular captain, he drew the sons of the principal agriculturists and tradesmen of the district into the ranks of the yeomanry and volunteer rifle, and it was his pride that his troop and his corps of volunteers were esteemed the smartest lot of men in either regiment, and (population considered) numerically as strong as any. In politics Mr Stuckey was a Conservative of the old school, and never swerved from the traditions of his party. In support of his opinions, he was fearless and outspoken, and never hesitated in declaring his belief that local affairs in the county were managed just as well and as efficiently under the old institutions, before the advent of councils and boards increased the expenses of administration. He was several times approached to become a candidate for parliamentary honours as a representative of one of the divisions of his county, but his time was so much taken up with his multifarious duties that he was obliged to decline the honour. He was an ardent Churchman, and all movements for the welfare of the Establishment never failed to receive his earnest and active support. His own parish church of All Saints and the neighbouring church of St. Mary, Huish Episcopi are indebted to his bounty and exertions for maintenance and restoration, and the Sunday Schools belonging to each have always received his most generous support. As a magistrate Mr Stuckey was painstaking and just, as a landlord he was kind and generous, and as a citizen he was affable and courteous to rich and poor alike, a gentleman in every sense of the word. His death will be deplored by all who knew him, and his place will be difficult to fill.",
07/08/1903,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Mark Whitwill,"A NOBLE CITIZEN\r\n\r\nThe news we publish with deep sorrow today of the sudden death of one of the noblest citizens Bristol has ever possessed will be received with equal regret by all classes of the community. Mr Mark Whitwill was known to Bristol in many capacities, but notably in four. He was eminent as one of the foremost of our commercial men and as truly a pioneer in that awakening of Bristol which can be traced back as far as the Free Port movement in 1849, in which Mark Whitwill, as a young man, took part. From that time to the present the port has been progressive, and in recent years the rate of progress has been more marked, it is but just to honour the work of the pioneers who did their utmost to stimulate the enterprise of their fellow-citizens, and to enable the city to take the position to which its natural advantages entitle it. Mr Whitwill's firm some thirty years ago, revived the direct steamship trade between Bristol and the United States, and he was one of the proposers of the Avonmouth Dock, when the City Council shrank from the task of an extension at the mouth of the river. A member, and at one time chairman, of the Chamber of Commerce, Mr Whitwill was always the advocate of progress, particularly in dock matters, and his high personal character and the respect in which he was held made him, during the most active years of his life, a noteworthy example of the highest type of commercial man. We remember Mr Whitwill in the second place for his municipal work. For some years he was one of the representatives of the old undivided ward of St. Philip and Jacob, and he gave to his municipal duties, as to the magisterial responsibilities that were long ago imposed upon him, the most diligent and conscientious attention. Next we have to remember Mr Whitwill as one of the foremost workers in the great cause of popular education. He was in the prime of life when Mr Forster's Education Act was passed, and it was generally recognised in the city that a gentleman so deeply interested in child life would be a fitting member of the newly created School Board. The first election, which resulted in the selection of as powerful and able a board as any provincial city ever contained, was a wonderful tribute to Mr Whitwill, for he was placed at the head of the poll by thousands of votes above any other candidate. He was immediately elected vice-chairman (Mr Lewis Fry was chairman), and for twenty-one years he gave to the work of the School Board an enormous amount of his time and work. For nine years as vice-chairman, and for twelve years as chairman, Mr Whitwill laboured on the School Board with a devotion that cannot be too highly praised. His courtesy, his fairness, his breadth of view in presiding over the deliberations of a necessarily heterogeneous body were warmly acknowledged. We repeat elsewhere the comments of his colleagues on the occasion of his retirement from the School Board, and it will be recollected that similar public utterances came from men of all creeds. When a man with the great experience of the Bishop of Hereford could speak of Mr Whitwill as one of the men most respected, no further evidence is needed as to the influence Mr Whitwill exerted, or of the esteem in which he was held by all whose esteem is worth having.\r\nIf Mr Whitwill's public life, or at least that part of his active and strenuous life which brought him before the public, had been confined to the tasks of which we have already written, it would have furnished a record of great public spirit, and signal devotion to the interests of his fellow-citizens. But all the work of which we have spoken was as nothing in his own view, and probably made no greater demands upon his time, compared with the noble hobby of his life. Mr Whitwill was a deeply religious man.\r\nHe had a lively interest in all forms of philanthropic enterprise, and it is a coincidence that last evening, almost simultaneously with our receiving the sad intelligence of his death, we received a report of the last public utterance of his life, in which only a few hours ago he commended to a gathering at St. Werburgh's the enjoyment to be derived from a study of beauty and of nature. It was a fitting close to a beautiful life, illustrating as it did the eminently practical nature of Mr Whitwill's religion, the breadth of sympathy that took him to a gathering of a religious communion to which he did not belong, and his friendly and unaffected interest in all that could brighten the lives of the workers. But it was in the Children's Hospital that all these qualities of Mr Whitwill were centred and best displayed. The noble building at the top of St. Michael's Hill is his monument. For nearly forty years Mr Whitwill has been pre-eminently 'the children's friend'. Long ago when the hospital was smaller and its work was less known than at present, Mr Whitwill was its devoted supporter, and he gave it his daily personal devotion. It is said that he never missed a day without calling at the Hospital, and the support that has been given it by all classes, both regularly and when special efforts have been needed, have been due to Mr Whitwill far more than to anyone else. It is no exaggeration, it is a strict and literal fact, that there are hundreds of our fellow citizens now living who would have perished in infancy or early childhood but for the great institution which Mr Whitwill nourished and tended and was the joy and pride of his life. Mr Whitwill had great mental capacity. He might have attained great wealth if he had been less devoted to child life in Bristol, and there may be business men who still think that the time he gave to the Children's Hospital and to the School Board might have been employed to mere lucrative advantage. But that Mr Whitwill's deliberate choice, from a high sense of duty, was what it was is a matter for the deepest thankfulness on the part of his fellow-citizens. The city is the better for having had Mr Whitwill in its midst, and now that the long and beneficent career has ended with startling suddenness, we feel sure we are expressing the general feeling in placing on record an appreciation of a life so lovable, so good, and so full of self-sacrifice.",
10/01/1905,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Dr Eubulus Williams,"DEATH OF DR EUBULUS WILLIAMS\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death of Dr Eubulus Williams, which took place yesterday, after a protracted illness, at his residence, 1 Lansdown Place, Victoria Square, Clifton. The deceased, who was the fifth son of the late Mr Joseph Williams, of Williton, Somerset, was born on the 20th July, 1831, and was therefore in his seventy-fourth year. He was educated at Taunton College, and at an early age matriculated at London University. He afterwards studied at Guy's Hospital, with which his connection was always maintained. Three of his brothers also received professional training at this famous institution - Joseph, to whose memory a public monument was erected at Arno's Vale in recognition of his heroic services during the cholera epidemic in Bristol; Clement, who, entering the army as surgeon, served in the Crimean war, made great researches in Burmah, and was afterwards appointed first English political agent for Upper Burmah; and a younger brother, Christopher. Very soon after the surgeon's degree was conferred upon him, Dr Eubulus Williams was chosen as house surgeon at Reading Hospital, and in 1855 (the year in which he obtained the M.D. degree) went north on his election as medical superintendent of the Dundee Royal Infirmary. He remained for between two and three years in Scotland, and then spent some time in visiting the medical schools in Paris, Berlin, and Vienna, his object being to acquire personal familiarity with their different methods of treatment. His tour was not a mere hasty run round, for he attended lectures and received certificates from various professors. Returning to England, he, in 1858, became a resident of Bristol, where he began practice, and a few months later he married Margaret, the eldest daughter of the late Mr Patrick Watson, of Dundee. Before he had been long in Bristol, Dr Williams became associated with Dr Mortimer Glanville and the late Dr Henderson in conducting a dispensary in St. James's Square for 'diseases of women and children'. The effort proved successful, and when it was ultimately merged in the Children's Hospital, on St. Michael's Hill, Dr Williams was elected on the surgical staff. Later he relinquished this position, but in 1863 was re-elected surgeon. His interest in the volunteer movement in the early days was shown by his becoming surgeon to the Bristol Artillery Corps. His practice had been so far in accord with the allopathic school of medicine, but in 1867 certain remarkable cures following homeopathic treatment were brought to his notice, and he was induced to give the subject much attention. As a consequence he became convinced that the principle on which homeopathy is founded - 'Similia similibus curantur' (like things are cured by like) - was a safe rule to follow in medical practice, and he made public that opinion in a pamphlet, which besides announcing the change in his views, explained that in adopting homeopathic therapeutics he did 'not renounce what is valuable in ordinary practice'. This adoption of homeopathy was followed by his resigning his position as surgeon to the Children's Hospital, and about the same time he was chosen physician to Muller's Orphanage. In this great institution he took  a deep and continuing interest, and he remained connected with it as physician for 34 years. He was president of the West of England Therapeutical Society from its formation down to 1893, and when the annual congress of the Homeopathic Society was held in Bristol in 1897 was vice-president. The next year the society met in London, and he then filled the presidential chair. It will be judged from his life history that he was a man of independent thought, and one who stood high in his profession; he had a kindly disposition and wide sympathies, and sincere regret will be felt among a large circle of friends that a long and honourable career has been brought to its close.",
19/02/1900,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr William Smith,"THE LATE ALDERMAN W. SMITH\r\n\r\nPULPIT REFERENCES\r\n\r\nThe death of Alderman William Smith, which occurred, after a brief illness, on Friday evening, has caused widespread regret in the city. For thirty-five years he had been one of the most conspicuous figures in the active life of Bristol, and he had rendered such service to his fellow townsmen that his name will long be remembered and esteemed. It was in 1865 that Mr Smith first took up his residence in Bristol, and succeeding Mr James Lyon in the commission business, which at that time was carried on in Marsh Street, he quickly took a prominent place amongst the commercial men of the city. After removing to Corn Street Mr Smith extended his business operations in many directions and he became one of the managers of the Bristol and West of England Canadian Land and Mortgage Investment Company, Limited, and the consulship for Chile was also in his hands. After a residence of five years, civic affairs claimed his active interest, and, as member of the Town Council for the Clifton Ward, he was able to bring his foresight and rare business ability to bear on municipal affairs. For 12 years - 1870 to 1882 - he continued to represent the Clifton Ward, but in the latter year a redistribution of seats occurred, and Mr Smith contested, with Mr W. R. Barker, the newly-made Westbury Ward. The fight was a keen one, Mr Smith being defeated by only eight votes. His services in the Council Chamber, however, were recognised in the following year, when he was made an Alderman, and  he continued to take the keenest interest in municipal affairs. In the Council House he was never conspicuous for lengthened speeches, but his opinion on subjects under discussion was given with characteristic force, and his utterances always commanded attention. In the year 1876 he held the office of High Sheriff, and a couple of years later he was appointed to the magisterial bench of the city. He was also one of the Justices of the Peace for the Lawford's Gate Division of the County, and on many occasions he has shown kindness of heart and practical sympathy with the poor. But, busy as the late Alderman Smith always was, he still found time to assist in the promotion of music in the city, and his services in this direction cannot be over-estimated. In conjunction with Sir George Edwards and other gentlemen, Mr Smith inaugurated the Bristol Music Festival, and his keen appreciation and judgment of high-class music were of the greatest assistance to the society. The concerts were invariably of the highest class, and many have reason to thank Mr Smith and those who acted with him for their opportunity to hear the best artistes of the day. To the majority of citizens the death of Alderman Smith came as a complete and painful surprise. He was in town as late as Monday last, but after riding home he complained of a cold, and, despite the skill of his medical attendant, serious complications ensued, and he expired at 6.30 pm on Friday from acute pneumonia. The deceased gentleman, who was 75 years of age, leaves a widow and three daughters, all of whom are married. The flag at the Mansion House floated at half-mast yesterday, and in deference to the memory of the deceased alderman  the Lord Mayor has postponed the Council meeting which had been fixed for Tuesday. The deceased gentleman had been a regular attendant at Christ Church, Clifton, and last evening the vicar, the Rev. T. C. Chapman, made sympathetic reference to his death, and spoke of the respect in which he was held by his fellow citizens.\r\nAt the morning service at the Mayor's Chapel yesterday, the Rev. J. H. Bright said he could not commence his sermon without first alluding to the great loss, the city had sustained by the death on Friday last of Mr William Smith. One could hardly realise that that kindly face, so familiar to them, would be no more seen among them, that they had hidden a long farewell to one who was the genial friend and companion of many, and who was deservedly respected by all who in business relations had to do with him. Very few men had devoted so many years of their life to municipal matters as he. For twelve years he represented Clifton Ward as one of its councillors; during that period, in 1876, he filled the honourable position of High Sheriff, and for the last seventeen years, as an alderman, he had given much of his time, his talents, and his experience, for the benefit of their city. Although he had not been looking well for some little time past, his death came as a shock to them all. It was quite unexpected. It was only on Sunday morning last he was present at his parish church, and on Monday, he believed, was as usual, at his place of business. Truly, in the midst of life they were in death. Might they take hold of the lesson themselves, and at the same time let them pray God that He might comfort, in their hour of sorrow and bereavement, all the members of the family in the great loss they had sustained. In accordance with custom the Funeral March would be played at the close of the service that morning as a tribute of regard to the memory of their departed friend. Mr Bright then preached upon the parable of the Sower, and at the close of the service, as he intimated, the 'Dead March' from 'Saul' was impressively played. The Right Hon. the Lord Mayor and the Lady Mayoress were among the congregation.",
05/05/1899,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mrs Emma Marshall,"DEATH OF MRS EMMA MARSHALL\r\n\r\nCAREER OF A SUCCESSFUL NOVELIST\r\n\r\nThe announcement of the death of Mrs Emma Marshall will be read with the deepest regret, not only in Clifton and the West of England, where she has for so many years resided, but everywhere where her many charming writings have been so eagerly read. At the end of March last Mrs Marshall, whilst   still engaged upon a serial story, had an attack of influenza. Her  illness at first was considered serious, but, as is so often the case with this ailment, complications followed, and death resulted from pneumonia at 11.30 yesterday morning. For a number of years the well-known novelist had made Leigh Woods her home; it was here that she laboured so long upon her literary work, and it was here that her well spent life closed. Almost a week ago her medical advisor - Dr Blagg - gave up hopes of her recovery, but she lingered on until yesterday morning, when she passed peacefully away in the presence of her family.\r\nIt would be difficult to convey even the faintest idea of the love Mrs Marshall had for the literary work she was so long engaged upon. Whilst yet a girl she was drawn to story writing, and her early efforts, which were chiefly on behalf of child readers, contained many indications of the gift which in after years developed to such a noteworthy degree. She will, perhaps, never be counted among the great novelists of the time, but her charming books have delighted thousands of readers, both English and foreign, for her books were in many instances translated into other languages than ours, and if genuine appreciation is any reward for a life of literary work, then Mrs Emma Marshall must have been well content with the result of her labours. She was at her best when treating upon historical subjects, and this class of literature has been enriched by many works from Mrs Marshall's pen. Her task was never entered upon lightly, and she seldom relied upon her prolific imagination for building up her historical tales. She invariably studied her subject deeply and thoroughly before weaving it into a tale of delightful interest, and it was this fact, together with the originality and freshness of her style, which made her works so popular. It is hardly necessary to point out to the West-country people how skilfully she has turned to account local historical scenes and incidents. In many instances her pen has drawn attention to and has made familiar local subjects which would otherwise have passed unnoticed save, perhaps, to the student of history. And it was her aim to give something more than a pretty story; her characters were not names only; they lived before the eye of the reader, and perusing the pages of her book one's mind was forcibly carried back to the olden times she loved so much to write about. Her partiality for ancient ecclesiastical architecture is well known; the cathedrals of our land were as familiar to her as was her own fireside. And it is not surprising to find many famous cathedral figuring so frequently in her works. Residence at Norwich, Exeter, and Gloucester gave her opportunities of becoming acquainted with the magnificent old cathedrals in those towns which she readily embraced, and the knowledge she thus acquired has constituted the theme for many interesting articles. Mrs Marshall's first published story was 'Happy Days at Fernbank', an unpretentious little work, but 'Life's Aftermath', of which 13,000 copies were circulated will rank as her most popular novel. Another success was 'Winifred's Journal', whilst amongst her later series 'The Master of Musicians, a story of Handel's Days'; 'Winchester Meads, in the Days of Bishop Ken', 'Under Salisbury Spire, in the Days of George Herbert', and 'In the Choir of Westminster Abbey', a story of Henry Purcell's days, were all received with much favour. There was at one time a big demand for Mrs Marshall's shilling books, and 'The Tower on the Cliff', 'The Two Swords', a story about the plague in Bristol; 'Bristol Diamonds', a tale concerning Chatterton, were all widely read. Of her many historical novels Mrs Marshall looked upon 'Under Salisbury Spire' as her best work. It is worthy of note that some years ago Princess Christian and Princess Beatrice of Battenbery accepted copies of Mrs Marshall's books. The deceased lady was a prolific writer and during her literary career - which extended over nearly half a century - she published a remarkably large number of books, but the following is a list of some of her most well-known works:- 'The White King's Daughter', 'The Master of Musicians', 'Kensington Palace', 'Penhurst Castle', 'In the Service of Rachael, Lady Russell', 'Winifrede's Journal', 'edward's Wife', 'Winchester Meads', 'Under Salisbury Spire', 'In the City of Flowers', 'On the Banks of the Ouse', 'In Four Reigns', 'Under the Mendips', 'Mrs Willoughby's Octave', 'The Mistress of Tayne Court', 'In the East Country', 'In Colston's Days', 'Constantia Carew', 'Dame Alicia Chamberlayne', 'Joanne's Inheritance', 'Life's Aftermath', 'Dorothy's Daughters', 'Nowadays', 'Mrs Mainwaring', 'Heights and Valleys', 'Helen's Diary', 'Escape from the Tower', 'Christabel Kingscote', 'Violet Douglas', 'Millicent Leigh', 'Brothers and Sisters', 'Lady Alice', 'The First Light on the Eddystone', 'Boscombe Chine', 'A Lily Among Thorns', 'Bristol Bells', 'A Romance of the Undercliff', 'Up and Down the Pantiles', 'The Old Gateway', 'Her Season in Bath', 'Bristol Diamonds', 'The Two Swords', and 'The Tower on the Cliff'. Mrs Marshall was born at Northrepps, Hill House, near Cromer, being the youngest daughter of the late Mr Simon Martin, and she married, in 1854, Mr Hugh Graham Marshall, of Clifton.",
12/03/1900,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Charles Hoskins Low,"DEATH OF ALD. C. H. LOW\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death of a prominent member of the Corporation of Bristol, in the decease of Alderman Charles Hoskins Low, who yesterday morning expired at his residence, Towerhurst, Leigh Woods. He was an authority on local dock matters, and gave much attention to the timber trade, being the head of the important firm of Taylor and Low Brothers, timber importers which he founded in 1855 cojointly with his brother, Mr James Beadel Low and the late Mr Henry Taylor, who was in 1879-80 Mayor of the city. The deceased was born at Clifton in 1831, and received his education at private schools. He commenced public life by representing St. Michael's Ward in the Council in 1873, and was elected alderman in 1891. He  did much useful work as chairman of the Sanitary Committee, remaining in that position for five years. Indeed, he laboured most enthusiastically for the advancement and welfare of his native city. After presiding over the deliberations of the Sanitary Authority, a body which has done a great deal to make Bristol one of the healthiest cities in the United Kingdom, Mr Low relinquished the chairmanship in order to accept the distinguished position of chairman of the Bristol Docks Committee. He held the latter appointment for ten years, and while he remained in office some undertakings of great moment to the port were discussed. One project was to provide coal shipping facilities at Bristol and extend the railways round the quays. Like some other dock schemes, this was debated at length in the Council, and after some delay certain railway facilities are being provided. When the scheme for promoting a new dock at Avonmouth was brought forward in 1892, Mr Low being chairman and Mr Charles Wills vice-chairman of the committee, the public looked forward to a speedy enlargement of the dock property. The scheme passed through the ordeal of a poll of the citizens, and went a certain distance on its parliamentary career, but had an unexpected ending. Just before a meeting of the Council plans were forwarded from the Great Western Railway Company referring to terms which had been presumed to be settled. the plans bore words intimating that terms were left to be arranged. This intimation was interpreted to mean that the matter had really to be argued over again, and Alderman Low, as chairman of the committee, withdrew the bill. Since then nothing has practically been done in the direction of enlarging the dock estate. Alderman Proctor Baker moved a resolution, which was adopted,  for the committee to bring up a well digested scheme. Alderman Low afterwards resigned the chairmanship of the Docks Committee, and Alderman Proctor Baker, who had been abroad several months, succeeded him. Some time ago, when feeling was displayed as to the attitude of the committee towards the timber trade in respect to charges for labour and handling wood goods, Alderman Low, who still remained a member of the committee, entered a vigorous protest against the new policy, and announced that he would leave the committee. Subsequently, however, he returned to the duties in which he had been usefully engaged. Other posts held by Alderman Low in the Council at the time of his death were the chairmanship of the Docks Finance Sub- Committee, and he served on the Dockisation Committee, which is an enlargement of the Docks Committee. He was also a member of the Loans Committee, and chairman of the committee of visitors at the Borough Lunatic Asylum. In 1887 he was appointed a justice of the peace for Bristol, and in the same year became president of the Grateful Society, his collection amounting to Â£9000. His knowledge of commercial affairs and his grasp of trade matters rendered him a valuable member of the council of the Chamber of Commerce and Shipping, and in 1865 he was chairman. He had been twice president of the Harbours, Docks, and Piers Association of the United Kingdom. He was president of the Timber Federation last year (the second time he had held that position), and was the first president and founder of the Bristol Channel Timber Importers' Association. So recently as the 27th February he attended the annual banquet of that association at Cardiff, and made a vigorous speech in proposing 'The Trade and Commerce of Cardiff'. He was a director of the Bristol Tramways and Carriage Company, Limited, and chairman of the Bristol and Clifton Building Society. Alderman Low was one of the earliest enrolled members of the 1st Gloucestershire (City of Bristol) Rifle Volunteer Corps at its inauguration in 1859, and for many years held the captaincy of No. 2 company. He passed through every grade to that of captain, being senior of his rank at the date of his retirement. His term of office as alderman of the city would have expired in 1904.\r\nAt the end of the service at the Mayor's Chapel, yesterday morning, the Mayor's Chaplain, the Rev. J. H. Bright, announced with regret that Alderman Low had died that morning. the Dead March in 'Saul' was played by the organist.",
04/05/1900,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Wilberforce Tribe,"DEATH OF MR WILBERFORCE TRIBE\r\n\r\nIt is with regret we have to announce the decease of Mr Wilberforce Tribe, senior partner in the firm of Messrs Tribe, Clarke, and Co., chartered accountants, of Albion Chambers, whose death took place suddenly at his residence, 7, Westfield Park, yesterday morning. The deceased gentleman, who was about 78 years of age, was at business on Wednesday, apparently in his usual health. He went out in the evening, and returning home, retired to rest. In the morning when he called he was found to be in a very exhausted condition, and death occurred shortly after. He had enjoyed fairly good health all the winter, and spent Easter at Llandrindod Wells, and his death under such conditions proved a great shock to his family and a large circle of friends. The deceased gentleman took a deep interest in religious and philanthropic work, and was one of the first members of the Redland Park Congregational Church on its foundation some 40 years ago. He was appointed a deacon from the opening of the church, and held that position until a few years ago, when he was appointed honorary deacon. He for a long period also held the position of secretary to the church, and for many years acted as treasurer. He was one of the earliest members of the Young Men's Christian Association; and for a long time represented Redland Park Church at the institution in St. James's Square. In politics the late Mr Tribe was a Liberal, and a member of the Liberal Club, and at one time was a treasurer of the Westbury Ward Liberal Association, but had not for some years taken an active part in political work. He took a keen interest in chess, and was a member of the Bristol and Clifton Chess Club. He was also very fond of cricket, and was often to be seen on the Downs watching the players. He was a magistrate for the city of Bristol, and took a deep interest in magisterial work. The deceased gentleman also for many years held the post of city auditor. At the time of his death he was a director of the Bristol and West of England Building Society, and of the Western Wagon and Property Company. He leaves a widow and five sons and three daughters. The eldest son, Mr W. N. Tribe, is connected with a firm of stockbrokers in this city, and the others are Mr Frank N. Tribe, Mr A. N. Tribe, and Mr Ernest N. Tribe, who are connected with the firm of which their father was the chief partner, and the Rev. O. N. Tribe, B.A. Miss Ethel Tribe is a medical missionary in China for the London Missionary Society.\r\nSpeaking at the Totterdown Y.M.C.A. last night, Mr S. D. Wills spoke feelingly of Mr Wilberforce Tribe, whose friendship he had enjoyed for 45 or 50 years. Mr Tribe was one of the most unselfish men he ever knew, one of the most modest men, one of the most generous, and his left hand did not know what his right hand did. He was one of the earliest members of the Y.M.C.A., in Bristol, and for many years represented Redland Park Church at the Y.M.C.A. He was one of the first members of Redland Park Church, and what he had been to that church, and especially to their beloved minister, no one could tell. Then think of Mr Tribe's sons and daughters - such a consecrated family was almost unique. One daughter, of brilliant ability, an M.D. of London, was a medical missionary in China, having gone there at the expense of the family. Mr Ernest Tribe was evangelising in the Shaftesbury district, and so he could not go. Bristol, and Redland Park Church, and all of them were the poorer because their friend Wilberforce Tribe had done his work and was taken home.",
23/03/1900,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Sholto Vere Hare,"DEATH OF MR SHOLTO VERE HARE\r\n\r\nThe announcement of the death of Mr Sholto Vere Hare will be received with sincere regret by a very large number of citizens. To the present generation his name conveyed little beyond the fact that he at one time was a parliamentary candidate for Bristol, but older folk whose recollections go further back will remember him both as a citizen whose public spirit and personal qualities brought him into prominence in municipal and political life, and a man who for kindliness of disposition had few equals. There was a time when he was fore most in many movements and when no Bristolian was better known to both 'the classes and the masses', but with advancing years public duties were naturally placed on one side for the enjoyment of that rest which a busy life had earned, and thus it is that Mr Hare years ago ceased to be the conspicuous figure in local affairs that once he was. His life was a long one: his eighty years embraced, perhaps, the most momentous period of Bristol's history, saw a marvellous transformation in its appearance and conditions of life, witnessed the lethargy of its leaders in taking advantage of the golden opportunities for extended commerce and shipping which again and again offered themselves, but afforded evidence that even these failures to utilise its natural advantages could not prevent the development with which now-a-day all are familiar. Mr Sholto Hare was associated with one of the leading industries in Bristol - the great oil, colour and floorcloth business of Messrs John Hare and Co. He entered the firm in 1840, and continued his connection with it until 1866. During this period he became a subscribing member to the Bristol Chamber of Commerce, and at a later period - in 1882 - when his nephew, Mr Chas. Felce Hare, became president of that important organisation, Mr Sholto Hare evinced a renewed interest in its proceedings. He entered the Council as an alderman while still engaged in active business life. His appointment was as long ago as 1856, and continued for the remarkable period of thirty-four years. His personal qualities won him a wide circle of friends, and the opinions of his fellow-members upon his fitness to preside over the deliberations, and to act as chief magistrate of the city, led them in November, 1862, to elect him as Mayor in succession to his brother, Mr John Hare, one of the members for Redcliff. During Mr Sholto Hare's Mayoralty Bristol celebrated on a lavish scale the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales, and in addition to the volunteer review, the processioning, the great gathering of school children, and provision of dinners for 10,000 poor people, and the illumination and decoration of the streets, Bristol marked the occasion by presenting to the Princess of Wales a magnificent sapphire pendant set in diamonds and placed in a carved casket of oak taken from Redcliff Church. Speaking of this casket, the London 'Times' observed that 'as a work of art it was as noteworthy and quite as beautiful an offering as the jewel itself'. In all these celebrations Mr Sholto Hare, as chief magistrate had much to do, and his wife (a daughter of Mr Clarke, of Trowbridge) ably assisted him in this public work. the gift to the Princess was made in the name of the ladies of Bristol by Mrs Hare, who was introduced to her Royal Highness by the Duchess of Beaufort. Another event of interest and importance during his mayoralty was the cutting by him of the first sod of the Port and Pier Railway. The undertaking thus started he had the satisfaction of opening it.\r\nThe reference to the venerable church of St. Mary, Redcliff, recalls the fact that Mr Sholto Hare was for many years officially identified with that building as its churchwarden. The association of the poet Chatterton with the sacred edifice excited his deep interest, and to him the city is indebted for placing Redcliff Churchyard the only statue which Bristol has of that remarkable but sad life. Chatterton has been a theme of much controversy, and even his monument did not escape a challenge. the vicar of that day, Parson Whish as he was popularly called, caused the statue to be removed from the position where it was first placed, and after disappearing from public-view for some years it was in 1857, as Mr John Latimer points out in his Bristol Annals 're-erected on the (unconsecrated) spot where it now stands, a few members of the parochial vestry having defrayed the cost of the restoration'. Mr Hare's year of chief magistracy began a long connection with the Bristol bench, and membership of the Society of Merchants resulted in due time in his being elected as master of that ancient society. Mr Hare was one of the most valued members of the Conservative party, and was often among the speakers at the Dolphin Dinner, the presidency of which he held in 1871. He was a popular president, and the collection which appears against his name, Â£948, was with one exception (Mr Charles Nash's Â£1,012 in 1869) the largest amount raised at one of the anniversaries of the society. He also was president of the Parent Society. 1871 also saw him a member of the first Bristol School Board elected in that year. In its work he was associated with Mr Lewis Fry (chairman), Mr Mark Whitwill, Mr Proctor Baker, the Rev. Dr Caldicott, the Rev. Dr Gotch, the Rev. Dr Percival, the Rev. Dr Waddy, Mr Herbert Thomas, Mr James Ford, and others. The recently passed Education Act gave rise to the keenest controversy. The pioneer work of the first board was not free from difficulties, and although Mr Hare's position at the head of the poll showed how popular he was with the electors, he left the board at the end of three years. \r\nThe Conservative party looked to him to fight their parliamentary battles, and the task was one calculated to absorb the energies of any man. Bristol was then an undivided constituency, and again and again evidence was afforded at the polls of the fact that Liberal feeling predominated in it. Mr Hare made his first appeal to the electorate in 1870. The veteran Mr Henry Berkeley, after holding a seat in no fewer than eight Parliaments, died on March 10th, and the vacancy brought forward a perplexing abundance of candidates. Mr Kirkman D. Hodgson was the official Liberal nominee, Mr E. S. Robinson had a large number of supporters, and Mr Odger, a labour candidate, all entered the field; and with the prospect of finding their opponents divided into three camps, it was not surprising that the Conservatives were anxious to seize an opportunity not likely to often present itself. But the Liberals settled their differences - at least in part - by a test ballot; the two lowest candidates on the list, Mr Hodgson and Mr Odger, dropped out as a result, and Mr Sholto Hare, the Conservative Champion, found himself confronted by one foe instead of three. The test ballot had not served to wholly unite the Liberals, but it undoubtedly saved them defeat, and Mr E. S. Robinson received 7,882 votes against 7,062 given for his opponent. The matter, however, did not end there. An election petition was presented against the newly-elected member on the ground that between Â£8 and Â£10 had been spent in treating electors by two agents not in the contest proper but in the test ballot. The point raised was a novel one, and eventually it ended in Mr Robinson being unseated, although it need hardly be said there was no suggestion that he was a party to the illegality which cost him his set. Mr Justice Bramwell, who tried the case, made a sympathetic reference to Mr Robinson on the peculiar circumstances that terminated his brief stay in the House of Commons. The Liberal Association again selected Mr Hodgson, and Mr Sholto Hare tried once more the fortune of electoral strife, but again was unsuccessful, the votes recorded being 7,816 for Mr Hodgson and 7,238 for Mr Hare.\r\nBoth these contests with which Mr Hare had been engaged were under the old order of things, for the ballot, pressed for by Mr Henry Berkeley and foreshadowed in the informal test election already alluded to, was still to become the law of the land. Few elections passed in those days without scenes of rowdyism, and even of actual violence; the nomination on the hustings was accompanied by disorder akin to that in pandemonium; the conflicts of feeling resulting from the system of open voting were neither conducive to public peace nor gave the continuance of personal friendships, and gave election day a character which it has lost altogether, or to a very large degree, since the introduction of the ballot. Mr Sholto Hare's career as a parliamentary candidate is interesting, because he shared in the last Bristol election under the old order, and also the first under the new. The latter was at the general election of 1874. Mr Hodgson had as a colleague Mr Samuel Morley, who had already for some time been one of the members for Bristol; the second candidate chosen by the Conservatives was Mr Chambers; the contest was a hard fought one, the Conservatives were most hopeful, and Mr Hare was nearer success than ever before, but was still outside Parliament. The figures were as follows:- Mr Hodgson, 8888; Mr S. Morley, 8732; Mr Sholto Hare, 8552; and Mr Chambers,7626. After this Mr Hare left his party to another champion, and Sir Ivor Guest, with equal gallantry tried in subsequent elections to wrest the seat from the Liberals, but in vain. In his electioneering campaigns Mr Sholto Hare was often accompanied by his wife; she won great popularity, both by her spirit and her amiability, and good feeling towards her took the practical form of a gift of jewellery.\r\nMr Hare was a man of cultivated and varied tastes. Antiquarian research had a charm for him, he was a collector of coins and of china, and was often seen at the Madrigal concerts. He was enthusiastic as a Volunteer. his corps was the Bristol Artillery, of one of the batteries of which he was captain. For some time Mr Hare resided at Stoke Bishop, but from there moved to the beautifully-situated residence in Knowle Park. He allowed numerous public functions to take place in the grounds during his stay there, and both he and his wife, at Almondsbury, by their hospitality and geniality, made many fresh friends in that district. Upon the death of Mrs Hare, Mr Hare erected as a memorial to her a handsome building at Almondsbury, for use as a club and convalescent home for the villagers. This he maintained for a good while at considerable expense to himself, and when Bristol determined that a convalescent home should be its memorial of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, Mr Hare generously offered this building as a gift to the city. There was a difficulty as to its acceptance, because it was felt that such an institution should be either in or close to Bristol, but the spontaneity of the offer elicited hearty acknowledgment. Mr Hare subsequently married Miss Adams, a Pembrokeshire lady, who survives him. He removed from Almondsbury to Clifton, and enjoyed fairly good health until the last few weeks, and, then although confined to the house, was not compelled to take to his bed until Wednesday. He was attended by Dr Blagg, but early yesterday morning failure of the heart ended a long and honourable life.",
27/06/1900,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Horatio Dunn,"DEATH OF MR HORATIO DUNN\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death of Mr Horatio Dunn, of Fairfield House, Bedminster. Mr Dunn was in his 95th year, and was in fairly good health until about six weeks ago. Notwithstanding his great age he followed the events of the day with a keen interest, and discussed with his friends the prospects of the campaign in South Africa with a critical intelligence which showed that he retained all the mental energy which distinguished him during his life. In some respects Mr Dunn occupied a unique position. He was originally associated with George and Robert Stephenson, the engineers of the first passenger railway in the world - the Stockton and Darlington - and the  Liverpool, Manchester, and other lines constructed in the early days of railway enterprise. He afterwards became associated with Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the first engineer of the Great Western Railway. This railway originated at a meeting in Mr Tothill's office on the Welsh Back, and when the first section - Bristol to Bath - was decided upon Mr Dunn was appointed to  superintend the taking of the traffic on the Bath Road, with a view to convince possible shareholders that the projected line would be a paying concern. He recently stated that if there had been no more traffic, than was found on the road on the day the statistics were taken a single train a day would have sufficed to carry it all. Mr Dunn was thus connected with the 'Great Western Company' before the line was made. On the day that the first locomotive was run from Bath to Bristol, Mr Dunn walked along the line from Bristol to Bath to make sure that the line was clear. Mr Dunn's memory, however, carried him far beyond the beginning of the Great Western system. He was three years of age when the water was first let into the New Cut in 1809, and had a vivid recollection of the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo. He also remembered the tremendous storm in December, 1814. Mr Dunn's close identification with the Great Western Railway Company brought him into contact with all the leading men connected with the line, and he reckoned among his personal friends Mr I. K. Brunel, Sir Daniel Gooch, Mr Grierson, Mr Charles Saunders, Mr Frederick Saunders, Sir Watkin Williams Wynn, Mr Owen (the second engineer of the line), Mr Armstrong (the late superintendent of the Swindon Works), and Mr Dean (the present superintendent). He was the last link connecting the present day with the opening of the Great Western Railway to Bath. He was under Brunel where the three Bristol tunnels were constructed, and it was at his suggestion that the two boulder stones, commonly known as the 'apple and pear', were placed on pedestals outside one of the tunnels. These stones fell from the roof of one of the tunnels, and are now fixed at each end of St. Anne's platform. At one time, when the railways were not permitted to burn coal in the locomotives, Mr Dunn had charge of the coke ovens near Bristol, and afterwards he became the store superintendent at Swindon - a position which he filled until 1892, when he retired. Mr Dunn was a native of Wivelfscombe, and a brother of the late Mr Alfred Dunn, of Bristol, and of Mr William Dunn, J.P., of Exeter. He lived to see a complete revolution in railway plant both as regards the permanent way and the rolling stock, and it was remarkable that he was able to read without spectacles the account of the accident at Slough station only a few days ago. In talking of old times, Mr Dunn stated that he knew a man who had talked with a man who had fought in the Monmouth rebellion, which collapsed at Sedgmoor in 1685. Along the Great Western line Mr Dunn was well known and highly respected by all grades of the employees, and to the last he took a deep interest in the affairs of the Great Western Company. He grew up with the railway system, and was one of the pioneers whose force of character, foresight, and energy helped to establish the system of steam locomotion, which has done so much for the world's progress. Personally Mr Dunn was admired for his urbanity, and had many intimate friends in this district, among them being the late Sir Joseph Weston. His recent bereavements were known to have affected his health. Within a comparatively short period he had to lament the loss of his son Arthur, whose career as a curate was full of promise, and later of his wife and also his elder daughter, Mrs Astapoff. The announcement of Mr Dunn's death, which occurred yesterday morning, will be received by all his friends with sincere regret.",
17/09/1900,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Daniel Travers Burges,"DEATH OF THE TOWN CLERK OF BRISTOL\r\n\r\nIt is with deep regret that we have to announce the death, on Saturday morning, of Mr Daniel Travers Burges, who for a period of 18 years was Town Clerk of Bristol. The sad event occurred at the residence of the deceased, 12, Vyvyan  Terrace, Clifton Park, after an illness extending over two years. He had for some time been suffering from an internal complaint, and afterwards had a paralytic stroke, which affected his left side. The Council, when his illness assumed a grave character, granted him six months' leave of absence. He was then, with his family, residing in Elmdale Road, near Tyndall's Park, but soon after removed to Vyvyan Terrace. Finding that his illness continued the Council extended his leave of absence to eight and subsequently to twelve months. As he was then found unable to resume his duties, Mr E. J. Taylor, who had held an important position in the Town Clerk's Office, was appointed Deputy Town Clerk, and still acts in that capacity.\r\nMr Burges, who was born in 1839, was a member of an old Bristol family, and may be said to have had had an hereditary position, since his father and grandfather both in turn held the appointment of Town Clerk. The grandfather was elected in 1836, resigning his position in 1849, although his death did not occur till April, 1864. He sat for some years as a magistrate at the Council House, and took considerable interest in the affairs of Clifton, attending the vestry meetings, where his speeches invariably received attention, as they were to the point, and couched in temperate language. Elder Bristolians may recollect him, and his exceedingly courteous demeanour. His son for a long time signed his name as Daniel Burges, jun., and he was appointed Town Clerk after the resignation of his father. Educated in Bristol Grammar School, he left that institution in 1827, and went as clerk to his father, who was at that time one of the solicitors to the Corporation, and continued in that capacity until the passing of the Municipal Reform Act. Immediately after the passing of that Act new arrangements had to be made in the various departments of the Corporation, and one of these was the appointment of Mr Burges to the office of Town Clerk in succession to Serjeant Ludlow. In consequence of this Mr Daniel Burges and Mr William Brice became joint clerks to the magistrates, and that appointment they continued to hold down to May, 1849, when Mr Burges resigned his office as Town Clerk, and Mr Burges, jun., was appointed his successor, Mr Brice becoming sole clerk to the magistrates, but both he and Mr Burges, jun., continuing as joint solicitors to the Corporation. It is not too much to say of Mr Daniel Burges, jun., that he discharged the difficult and often delicate duties of his office with great skill, and a conscientious regard for the interests of the city with which he had been so long closely associated. His extensive knowledge of civic affairs, coupled with his urbanity towards all  who were brought into contact with him, eminently fitted him for the office which he had so worthily filled for a quarter of a century. He died suddenly at his residence in Canynge Road, Clifton, in his sixty-fifth year. For four or five years he had suffered from palpitation of the heart and in consequence had been warned by his medical advisors to refrain from over-exertion or excitement. The late Mr Christopher J. Thomas, who was Mayor, paid a fitting tribute at the police court to the unswerving integrity and fidelity to his duties of Mr Daniel Burges, and at a meeting of the Bristol City and County Club, held at the Commercial Rooms, the late Mr Robert Lang expressed the general feeling of the members at the mournful event. No inquest was held, as Dr Britton certified the immediate cause of death to have been heart disease.\r\nA special meeting of the Municipal Council was convened for the purpose of electing a successor to Mr Burges; and the aldermen and councillors having passed in silence a long resolution recording the merits of the deceased, next adopted a report of the Finance Committee recommending the appointment of Mr William Brice. In the resolution submitted was the following: -\r\n'That if the Council see fit to adopt this arrangement the committee will be prepared at an early period to submit them suggestions for the future conduct of the business of the Town Clerk's office.' This intimation had reference specially to Mr Daniel Travers Burges, the deceased having left a widow and eight children, of whom Mr Travers Burges was one. He was at the time of his father's death practising as solicitor in London, the work of the Bristol Corporation had become onerous, so that it was suggested he should become assistant to Mr Brice, with a view to being appointed Town Clerk when the latter resigned. The arrangement was found to work well, since Mr Travers Burges from his legal training proved able to grasp the business of the Council, and Mr Brice taking a strong interest in the young man on account of the friendship he had for his father, the assistant clerk speedily became competent to conduct the affairs of the Corporation.\r\nIn 1880 Mr Brice resigned, and soon afterwards was appointed a magistrate for the county of Gloucester, sitting at Lawford's Gate. Mr Travers Burges was unanimously chosen Town Clerk, and it is not too much to say that since his appointment he discharged his duties with efficiency. The work of the city increased greatly after his succession to the office, for besides the ordinary business much labour was involved in respect to the competition between port and rival docks at the mouth of the Avon before the latter were acquired for the city. Hence great responsibility was thrust upon the Town Clerk, who, besides being appointed clerk to the Docks Committee, was afterwards chosen clerk to the Sanitary Committee. He was in addition clerk to the Cattle Market trustees. Mr Burges enjoyed the esteem of all the members of the legal profession in Bristol, and was on the governing body of the Incorporated Law Society. He was married to Miss Travers, and leaves a widow, three sons (who are now at the front), and two daughters.",
08/10/1900,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr William Butler,"DEATH OF MR WILLIAM BUTLER\r\n\r\nMr William Butler, for some time has been lying seriously ill at his residence, Clifton Grove, passed peacefully away on Saturday evening. He lived to the venerable age of 81, and his career afforded a striking example of the energetic Englishman. He possessed great force of character, shrewdness, and large business capacity. He was also eminently a religious  man, and assisted in many philanthropic movements. He established the important undertaking in the east part of the city which has for a long period been carried forward under the style of William Butler and Company, turpentine and resin importers, Silverthorne Lane, with works at Crew's Hole and at Upper Parting, Gloucester. He was greatly aided by his son, Mr William Henry Butler, who has for several years had the control of the business. When the Bristol Tramways Company was formed, Mr Butler assisted in the development of what has since proved a very extensive enterprise, and in his capacity as chairman of the board of directors proved a most competent head of the system which from its commencement had the advantage of so-competent a secretary as the present managing director, Mr George White. Partly through the influence which he obtained on account of his commercial association with St. George and partly on account of his individual energy, Mr Butler was early regarded as a leader in affairs in this extensive parish, and being a pronounced Liberal in politics, he, in company with the late Mr Handel Cossham and a few other gentlemen of advanced views, was enabled to render considerable assistance to the party in West Gloucestershire, and later in Bristol East when the parliamentary representation of the city was altered, and this part of the county included one of the four divisions. Prior to the extension of the city boundaries, Mr Butler for several years acted as chairman of St. George Highway Board, and so valuable were his services deemed that he was requested to sit for his portrait, which was presented to him and remained in the board room. The recipient, gratified at this acknowledgment of the labour of love which he had undertaken for the good of a parish in which he was so deeply interested, invited the subscribers to a banquet at the Montague Hotel, Kingsdown. From 1887 to 1890 Mr Butler sat in the Bristol City Council as a representative of St. Philip South, having defeated Mr George Belsten, the Labour candidate. The claims of his business and demands made upon him in respect to different religious and social matters in which he was warmly interested, prevented him seeking re-election as a councillor. He was a magistrate of the Lawford's Gate division. Perhaps no portion of his long and useful life afforded him more gratification than that devoted to religious objects. He was a member of the United Methodist Free Church, and not only gave largely to the funds of the local chapels, being especially interested in the cause at Redland Grove, but had represented Bristol at the annual assemblies of the denomination. He leaves several children, his eldest son, Mr W. H. Butler, being a magistrate  for the Lawford's Gate division, representing St. George ward in the City Council since 1897, and acting as chairman of Bristol East Liberal Association, thus following closely in the steps of the deceased gentleman.",
20/10/1900,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr W. H. Budgett,"DEATH OF MR W. H. BUDGETT, J.P.\r\n\r\nThe news of the death of Mr W. H. Budgett, J.P., which took place yesterday afternoon at Portishead, will be received with deep regret in Bristol. As head of the firm of Messrs W. H. and S. Budgett and Co., Limited, the deceased gentleman was known far beyond the limits of Bristol, while in the city itself some fifty years of philanthropic work have brought him into contact with hundreds of Bristolians to whom his death will appeal most deeply. Mr Budgett has been in ill-health for a long time. So far back as Christmas his condition was regarded as somewhat critical, the trouble being a weak heart, but he recovered somewhat and a little while ago went to Portishead. Though the warm weather was much appreciated by him the change proved scarcely beneficial, and during the last week or two a decline set in, with the sad result that Mr Budgett passed away, as stated above, yesterday afternoon. Mr W. H. Budgett was the son of Mr Samuel Budgett, whose career has become well known through the publication of 'The Successful Merchant', the work of the Rev. W. Arthur. 'The Successful Merchant' lived and carried on business at Kingswood, and while the private residence is still in existence, the business portion was destroyed by fire shortly after the present extensive premises were requisitioned. Several objects connected with the private life of the late Mr Samuel Budgett were shown during the visit of the Grocers' Federation to Bristol in July, including oil paintings of himself, his wife, and parents, while among the curiosities exhibited was a rare bank note issued by Jones, Brain, and Budgett of Kingswood Hill, probably between 1810 and 1820. This has been specially noticed by Mr C. H. Cave in his 'History of Banking in Bristol'. The document, however, which then excited the most curiosity was the manuscript copy of Samuel Budgett's instructions to travellers. This, as well as the diary of the last two years of his life, indicates the exceptional care and method which were always displayed by 'the successful merchant'. The  twenty-four hours were duly apportioned, sleep claiming seven (from 10p.m. to 5a.m.), while the record of events also deals with the time spent in the library and the books read. Some of the old invoices on exhibition were likewise of extreme interest, showing, for example, the extraordinary level of prices ruling in the early years of the century. These relics are greatly treasured by the members of the family.\r\nAfter the death of Mr Samuel Budgett the business was managed by the three sons, James, William Henry, and Samuel. The eldest, James, started a branch in London, which subsequently carried on under the name of Messrs James Budgett and Son, Limited, and has grown into a large and important business. He is now living at Stoke Park, Guildford, Surrey. Mr Samuel Budgett, the third son, is also living retired, at Beckingham, Kent. During the time of Mr W. H. Budgett's connection with the business the premises in Bristol have been greatly extended. The old Bridewell was purchased in 1872, and the present commodious buildings now occupy a large site, extending from Rupert Street to Nelson Street, with a large frontage to the latter thoroughfare and Bridewell Street. About three years ago the business was converted into a limited liability company, of which Mr W. H. Budgett has been the chairman. Latterly, however, owing to indifferent health, he has been unable to take an active part in its management. Though a Liberal in politics, Mr Budgett did not identify himself with any political movements, neither did he occupy the position of a representative on the Town Council at any time. As a magistrate, however, he frequently sat on the bench at the Bristol petty sessions. At the first Bristol School Board election in 1871, Mr Budgett was returned fourth on the list, and in addition was re-elected in 1874 and 1877, and was a painstaking and business-like member. It is probable, however, that amongst the religious body with which he was connected, the Wesleyan Methodists, his loss will be most extensively felt. He was formerly identified with Trinity Wesleyan Chapel, White Ladies Road, and was circuit steward of Clifton with the late Mr Thomas Pethick, father of the present Alderman Pethick. He afterwards attended the Victoria Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, opposite the Victoria Rooms, and was for many years treasurer of the Bristol District Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society. He showed a keen and practical interest in nearly all the Wesleyan day schools in Bristol. For many years he was secretary of the North Street Schools, and up to the time of his death held that position with regard to the Hanham day schools. His practical sympathy was also shown in connection with the building of a great many chapels in and around Bristol. But it was not only towards his own denomination that Mr Budgett's generosity was bestowed. When living at Stoke House, those of other religious convictions were often entertained by the deceased gentleman. Many an enjoyable garden party was given in the grounds. His philanthropic work extended in many directions. Numerous charitable institutions have cause to remember Mr Budgett's practical help and generosity. For over thirty years he was closely associated with the Strangers' Friend Society, discharging with energy the secretarial duties connected therewith. He was a member of the committee of the Children's Hospital, and was chairman of the Executive Committee of the Formidable Training Ship. Mr Budgett was associated with the erection of the Colston Hall, and became a shareholder of the company. Though not so closely identified with the Y.M.C.A. movement as his brother, Mr Samuel Budgett, who was treasurer of the institution in St. James's Square for many years, Mr W. H. Budgett contributed liberally to its exchequer from time to time. He leaves a widow, four sons, and two daughters. Three of the sons, Mr W. Edward Budgett (who is a county councillor for the Westbury ward, and lives at Henbury), Mr James Herbert Budgett, and Mr Charles Budgett, have been actively associated with the business in Bridewell Street for some years. The fourth son, Mr J. S. Budgett, has achieved distinction at Cambridge University, and has taken part in natural history expeditions to Africa and South America. The deceased gentleman was as 72 years of age, and resided at No. 6, Litfield Place, Clifton.",
19/01/1899,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr John McCurrich,"THE LATE MR MCCURRICH\r\n\r\nA very painful impression was created in the commercial circles of Bristol yesterday by the announcement of the death of Mr John M. McCurrich, the Chief Engineer at the Corporation Docks. The feeling of deep regret caused by the sad event was not unleavened by surprise, because some of the recent bulletins issued from the residence of the deceased in Clifton seemed to suggest more than the possibility of a successful rally from the malady which had begun to develop acute symptoms less than a more ago. But even the sound constitution of Mr McCurrich was unable to resist the inroads of the more or less complicated disease - which was not improbably aggravated by the abnormal humidity of the atmosphere - and the mournful climax of the struggle was reached yesterday morning. A valuable and purposeful life has thus been cut off at a period when the majority of robust men are generally considered to be at their best. For Mr McCurrich had reached an age no greater than that of forty-six years. With the grit and energy which mark the typical Scotchman, the deceased gentleman had but little difficulty, as a professional man, in impressing his personality on the public mind of his adopted city. He was born in a remote part of Perthshire, and his earlier predilections were for the work of the civil engineer. With the view to thoroughly equip him for the position at which he aimed, Mr McCurrich embarked on the recognised course of study; and on the conclusion of his terms at Edinburgh University he graduated as M.A. But the real and arduous work of his professional life had to be faced, and Mr McCurrich braced himself to the task with a cheeriness and determination which soon carried him to the front rank. He became attached to the staff of the Docks Engineer during Mr Girdlestone's time, in 1885; and that appointment, after a brief interval, transferred his activities from one side of the Bristol Channel to the other - from Cardiff to Bristol. For five years he was assistant engineer at Bristol, and when, in 1890, Mr Girdlestone resigned, Mr McCurrich assumed the onerous responsibilities of chief of the engineering staff. There were on the Docks Committee at that time certain members who advocated the course of going outside for a successor to Mr Girdlestone. But there were others who had more closely studied Mr McCurrich's character and methods, and who had had opportunities of forming a correct estimate of his abilities. In Mr McCurrich the latter perceived a man in every respect fitted for the vacant position - a man trustworthy, able, energetic, and resourceful. When Mr McCurrich's claims came to be subjected to serious analysis the ultimate decision was never in doubt, and he entered into the discharge of the full responsibilities of the office amidst a practically unanimous chorus of approval. There has never, during the past eight or nine years - years fraught with momentous issues in the development of the Bristol docks - been afforded the slightest cause for regret at the decision of 1890. Mr McCurrich buckled down to his work with an earnestness and determination beyond all praise. He enabled the local administrative body to solve many problems - amongst them the floods difficulty - of immense importance to the civic welfare, and he never begrudged a lavish expenditure of time on the elucidation of such knotty problems as his employers were from time to time compelled to submit to his ripe experience and sound judgement. Indeed, those who were privileged to enjoy the closer comradeship of Mr McCurrich do not hesitate to affirm that he allowed himself to become too deeply absorbed in his professional labours and their incidental anxieties. He was a master of mental concentration, and in the superintendence of the thousand and one details springing from the extensive and important works committed to his charge, he was the personification of industry and skilled activity. The pressure of his engagements, and the multiplication of his anxieties as each new crises in docks' affairs developed to the acute stage, are believed to have had at least an indirect influence on his otherwise robust health. But however that may be, Bristolians will to-day keenly realise that the city has lost a faithful and conscientious employee, and a man who had a bright and true conception of the essential duties of citizenship. But though placed in a position of high responsibility and considerable power, and, moreover, a man upon whom many distinctions had been bestowed, Mr McCurrich studiously refrained from any personal or ostentatious display. He steadfastly pursued the course which he mapped out for himself, and the twin virtues of urbanity and modesty, in conjunction with his other qualities, won him an enviable place in the affections of those thrown into business contact with him, as well as those who composed the circle of his immediate friends. The conscientiousness and ability which underlay the numerous reports and recommendations drawn up by the  deceased Docks Engineer have been universally recognised. And at the present juncture, when the question of docks extension in Bristol is rapidly moving towards another crises, the lamented demise of Mr McCurrich will amount to something little short of a disaster. The enlarged Docks Committee was, of course, in close touch with Mr McCurrich's later views; and we have reason to believe that much has been done towards the formulation of the new eagerly expected report on the merits of the Avonmouth extension and dockisation; but none the less, the almost sudden withdrawal of Mr McCurrich's mature influence from these deliberations must necessarily exercise some effect on the general situation. It only remains to be added that Mr McCurrich, despite his retiring disposition, was a man of varied sympathies, and he  unobtrusively identified himself with several deserving movements. He was a leading light in the Caledonian Society - now amalgamated with the Bristol Burns Club - and he took a prominent position in the Presbyterian body in the city. Mr McCurrich's unwearied and disinterested labours on behalf of what is really the Port's greatest interest will readily be acknowledged by the inhabitants of Great Bristol. With Mrs McCurrich and her young family there will be a deep and sincere sympathy in their sudden and sad bereavement.",
20/09/1899,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr William Day Watts,"DEATH OF MR W. D. WATTS\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death - which took place at one o'clock yesterday morning - of Mr William Day Watts, a member of the firm of Messrs Bramble, Watts, Grey, and Page, solicitors, of this city. Mr Watts had been in failing health for some considerable time, but so sudden a collapse was not anticipated until Sunday, the 10th inst., when the illness assumed an alarming stage, and he was practically unconscious from that time. Mr Watt's death removes from Bishopston one of its best-known and most respected residents. Almost from the day of his entry upon residence into that important suburb, Mr Watts had been more or less closely identified with its public life and development. The Horfield Local Board, the first of its kind in the Bristol district, was established in the year 1865. Three years later Mr Watts was elected a member, and at once became chairman of that body. With the thoroughness which characterised him in every department of his daily life, he threw himself unreservedly into the duties and heavy labours of his new office. During the seven years he presided over Horfield's representative body the parish made rapid strides, and came to be regarded as a healthy and popular residential district. The passing of the Public Health Act, 1875, which collated and enlarged the powers conferred on Local Boards of Health, engaged, during its passage through Parliament, Mr Watts's closest attention. Through the courtesy of Colonel Kingscote, then member for West Gloucester, he obtained an advance draft of the bill, and in the light of his experience as an administrator made a number of suggestions, every one of which was adopted by those responsible for the bill. More than one clause in the Act was accepted, and is engrafted in the precise terms which he had suggested. At the close of seven years' unremitting attention as chairman, Mr Watts sought rest and retired from the board, on which occasion he was presented by public subscription with the portraits (in oil) of himself and Mrs Watts. Though still prominent in all questions affecting the welfare of his fellow-parishioners, Mr Watts was not prevailed upon to again take office until the establishment of County and Urban District Councils, when, without opposition, he became the representative of the united parishes of Horfield, Filton, and Stoke Gifford at Gloucester. There his clear perception and sound judgment speedily marked him out as an able man amongst many such, and the County Council parted with him with no small regret when he had to vacate his seat consequent upon the absorption of Horfield by Bristol. As solicitor to the Horfield Urban District Council it became Mr Watts's official duty to oppose the absorption of the district into the city, but apart from this he personally would have done so from the conviction that all the benefit was on the side of the city. This opinion he held to the end. Mr Watts's death has also deprived the Manchester Unity of Oddfellows of one of its prominent and useful members. He was a member of the Widows' Hope Lodge, but his valuable services soon extended beyond his lodge, and were gladly accepted by the Bristol district and the Unity at large. He served the office of Grand Master of the district as far back as 1865, and was afterwards a frequent attendant at the A.M.C.'s of the Order, where his ability and the soundness of his views were speedily recognised. At the Chesterfield A.M.C. in 1870 he was elected secretary of the Relief Committee, and at the Exeter A.M.C. in 1878 he was honoured by being elected chairman of that committee, which office he again filled at Cardiff in 1882, Nottingham in 1883, Reading in 1884, and Aberystwyth in 1885. Owing to failing health, he had not been able in recent years to maintain the same active work for the Order, but his interest was unabated, and in his position as senior trustee for the district his valuable assistance and advice were always forthcoming at the meetings of the Management Committee. Deceased, who was 61 years of age, leaves a widow, one son, and three daughters, with whom much sympathy will be felt in their sad bereavement.",
07/01/1898,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Augustine Prichard,"DEATH OF MR AUGUSTIN PRICHARD\r\n\r\nWe deeply regret to record the death of Mr Augustine Prichard, the eminent surgeon, which took place at his residence, 4, Chesterfield Place, Clifton, at midnight on Wednesday. Mr Prichard was a native of Bristol, the second son of the late Dr. James Cowles Prichard, the famous ethnologist. He was educated first at a school kept by a Mr Norton at the bottom of St. Michael's Hill, then at the old Bristol College, Park Row. Several of his brothers obtained scholarships and subsequent fellowships at Oxford, and he was sent for a scholarship at the University, but the whole bent of his mind was to medical and surgical studies and he remained in Bristol. In 1834 at the early age, as it would be thought now-a-days, of 16 he was apprenticed or five years to his uncle, Mr John Bishop Estlin, the founder of the Eye Dispensary, himself a surgeon of considerable note. The opportunities thus afforded him of studying the diseases of the eye led him to adopt the subject as his speciality, and he became one of the leading ophthalmic surgeons of his day, several important operations and details of treatment owing their origin to his skill and insight. After serving his five years' apprenticeship and pursuing his studies at the Bristol Medical School and Infirmary, Mr Prichard removed to London, to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, where he became a dresser to Sir William Lawrence, and he remained for a year, going aboard to Berlin and Vienna in 1841 and to Paris in 1842. At Berlin he took his Doctor of Medicine degree.\r\nIn October of the same year he returned to Bristol, and commenced practice at the Red Lodge, in Park Row, now the reformatory school for girls, and which had been his father's residence. He soon became connected with the Medical  School, at which he was always a most successful and popular teacher, and in 1849 he was elected surgeon to the Infirmary. Here too his great skill in operating, and his clinical instruction, attracted a large number of students, who were eager to serve as his dressers, and there are many among  the senior members of the profession in the city and neighbourhood, and indeed scattered throughout the whole country, who must recall with gratitude his well-directed, practical teaching. He was compelled by a regulation (now wisely abolished) of the Infirmary Committee to resign his appointment after twenty years' service, just when really he was in the full vigour of life and most serviceable to the institution.\r\nAfter this event he was mostly occupied with a large private practice, very much of it being ophthalmic work; but besides this he was frequently called away to distant parts of the country for serious surgical operations. Nor was his private practice his only occupation, for he found time for considerable literary work and for scientific studies and attendances at the meetings of the local branch of the British Medical Association. He was an active member of the council of the branch and its president, and one of the founders of the Bristol Medico Chirurgical Society, of which he was one of the earliest presidents. At two of the annual meetings of the British Medical Association he was selected to read the address in surgery, an honour, we believe, which has been accorded no one else, and at the jubilee of the same society, when a meeting was held at Worcester, where it was originally founded, he was president of the surgical section. From its formation until he gave up practice Mr Prichard was surgeon at Clifton College, and there can be no doubt but that his connection with it and the confidences which he inspired helped to bring the school to its present flourishing condition. In 1893 Mr Prichard finally retired from practice, and his remaining years he spent in congenial pursuits, not losing sight of his interests in the Infirmary medical school and medical societies and other professional matters. He was a constant attendant at the meetings until during the last twelve months, his increasing deafness made him give them up. Next to his surgical work, painting was his chief delight, and he left a very large number of water-colour drawings, bits of the old city, many of them well executed. He was a frequent contributor to the medical journals, and published a two volume work entitled, 'Ten Years Operative Surgery'.\r\nWithin the two years he wrote an interesting and pleasantly written little volume probably known to many of our readers giving an account of some of his reminiscences.\r\nOn the Monday before Christmas he was taken ill with symptoms of intestinal obstruction, which necessitated a serious operation. But although attended with great temporary relief, his age and the severity of the attack made it hardly likely he would recover, and he sank from exhaustion. His unvarying kindness and skill, with no thought of personal trouble, and his genuine sympathy endeared him to a very large number of patients and friends, by whom his memory will be for ever cherished. Mr Prichard married, in 1845, Mary Sibellah, the daughter of the Rev. Thomas Ley, vicar of Rame in Devonshire. By her he has left a family of four sons and three daughters to mourn his loss.",
11/03/1898,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr George Muller,"GEORGE MULLER\r\n\r\nThe busy, happy, and laborious life of George Muller was ended  yesterday morning by a death which was one, as the Rev. Dr. Glover said at the Free Church Congress yesterday afternoon, all might envy, none might pity. Mr Muller had lived long, and his work in Bristol had been more or less familiar to every Bristolian. Indeed, there are very few living who can remember when the Orphan Houses were first established; the majority, including even those who have to call themselves elderly, have known the Orphan Houses all their lives, and from their earliest years they have heard with admiration, respect, and with something perhaps of wonder of the noble work and the simple religious faith of the founder of those great institutions. It is not easy to speak of Mr Muller and to observe that reticence upon sacred subjects which is seemly on the part of a secular journal. For Mr Muller had no history, no work that was not permeated by his religious faith. In another part of this newspaper the story of his marvellous life is told at some length. As a mere history it is remarkable and interesting. It is the story of a man 'in travels oft, in labours more  abundant', and the growth of the wonderful orphanage, the establishment of day schools, the foundation and growth of the Scriptural Knowledge Institution, the oversight of mission stations, the missionary or, so to speak, apostolic journeys, for Mr Muller was in a very real sense a Bishop - all these varied activities and responsibilities form  a record of a life of activity and devotion that has no modern parallel. Happily the Church - using the term in its broadest sense - has had many noble sons in recent years. No one who has read the stories of the lives of PATTISON and HANNINGTON, of MOFFATT and CHALMERS can have failed to be impressed by the high sense of duty, the sense of ease, the influence of belief on character that have been thus revealed.\r\nIn the presence of some great men the particular form of church government to which they were attached sinks into insignificance, and those who are most attached to their own convictions feel, that beyond the pale of their particular body there are men guided by an influence before which all men who think at all must bow in reverence. George Muller belonged to the small but wonderful class who compel a recognition of the limits of sectarian difference. Mr Muller was a member of one f the smaller of the many religious bodies in this country. His views on many points were not shared by the majority of those 'who profess and call themselves Christians'. But it is probable that many such when pained by what they may have considered the narrowness of view on the part of Mr Muller  were overwhelmed and silenced by the thought of the man and his life-work. They were forced to realise that there was compatible with views they did not share a life of such a quality as to silence criticism, and a work that could not be spoken of in the terms whereby we appraise merely human success.\r\nIt is impossible, as we have said, to speak of George Muller, and to exclude all reference to the great principle that underlay all his work - no mere academic acknowledgment of the existence of 'a force external to ourselves that makes for righteousness', but a simple belief and daily dependence upon Divine guidance and support. It took a form which we who have lived in Bristol have long associated with him. His Orphanage has been 'a charity that never begs', and the way it has grown and been sustained, the number of times that help has come to it when it was most sorely needed, despite the refusal of Mr Muller to adopt methods which many excellent men in charge of philanthropic institutions feel perfectly justified in adopting - all these are matters in connection with his Orphanage that have not lost their wonder by familiarity. Mr Muller's personality, his work, his philosophy of life, have presented to the world an object lesson of which the most unsympathetic could not think without respect. Never was there a philanthropist with less of fanaticism and more of method. His bearing and his speech were not those of an emotional enthusiast who would incur heavy liabilities with a light heart; indeed had he been such a man his life would have been less surprising than it was; it was his calmness and confidence, associated with the most careful watchfulness over expenditure  and most business-like habits, that presented a combination of qualities altogether unique and wholly surprising. And as to the work that he has done, there cannot be two opinions. No more necessary form of philanthropy, no more appealing more strongly to the right feeling, has ever been devised than one that takes care of children bereft of their natural guardians. In the long period of nearly seventy years that has elapsed since Mr Muller first commenced what came to be the chief work of his life, a vast army of children, a number equal to the population of a large city, must have passed under his care and that of the workers who have been associated with him. In all of these cases lives have been saved from destitution, in many cases from surroundings inimical to right training, and the boys and girls have been prepared for useful and honourable lives. There was no flattery in the resolution that was adopted at the Free Church Council yesterday declaring that 'Mr Muller has  left behind him a record of services to the orphan and destitute which will long remain an inspiration to the hope and effort of those whose hearts are touched by human necessity'. His record of services has, indeed, already been such an inspiration. Orphanages were rare when Mr Muller's work was commenced; they are numerous now, and can it not be said that some, at least, of these owe their establishment to the existence and example of the great institution at Ashley Down? The sound of Mr Muller's work has gone out into all lands, and it is simply impossible to try to estimate the extent of the influence, directly and indirectly, which he has exerted in the course of his long life. And the Fellow-citizens of Mr Muller, with unanimity that will sweep away all distinction of creeds, can feel something of pride that such a life and such a work have been lived and carried on in this city, and that, of all places in the world, it has been Bristol that has seen every day the continuance of a career which has been watched from afar by all the world that cares for and respects practical philanthropy with perfect sincerity and noble simplicity of life. And the end has come without the sadness of farewell. Life continued in strength and vigour to the last hour before natural sleep. Yesterday, there was sent to this office a signature written by Mr Muller on the evening before his death. There was no weakness in it, no tremulousness of age, and it is pleasant - if such a word can be fitly used in such a connection - to think that life ended with Mr Muller so peacefully and painlessly, and that to him it was given to realise the lines, 'Choose thine own time, Give little warning, Say not good night, but in some brighter clime, Bid me good morning' to life.",
01/09/1898,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr William Lane,"THE LATE MR WILLIAM LANE\r\n\r\nThe death of Mr William Lane, which was announced in yesterday's Press, removes a gentleman who, though ill-health prevented him taking any active part in public affairs, was formerly prominent in business circles in Bristol as well as a leading member of the Docks Committee. He represented the ward of St. Michael in the Municipal Council for nine years, and gave much time and attention to matters affecting the port. When he came to Bristol, a mere lad, he had a clerkship in the office of Messrs Stoate and Hosegood, the latter being his uncle. He soon acquired business habits, and after filling some responsible positions became partner in the firm. He was associated with the Wesleyan body, and appointed a local preacher, being principally connected with Trinity Chapel, Redland. In connection with the denomination he did much useful work, and devoted himself largely to Sunday school teaching. Though a busy man as a corn merchant, Mr Lane was able to give attention to matters affecting the trade of the city generally. He was an active member of the Bristol Chamber of Commerce for eight years, being elected a member of the council at the monthly meeting of that body on the 15th of May, 1874. In 1881 he was elected a member of the Bristol Town Council, and at the November meeting of the chamber that year Mr Henry Taylor, on behalf of the council, expressed their pleasure at having amongst them another town councillor in the person of Mr William Lane, and they trusted that Mr Lane's election to that body would be the means of strengthening the hands of the chamber and furthering its objects. Mr Lane, in reply, said he was pleased to say that he was not the only member who had been bought into public life by the Bristol chamber, and that it was his intention to continue to devote as much of his time as formerly to the work of the chamber. It was, however, in December, 1881, that a letter was read from Mr William Lane stating that in consequence of his many civic engagements he was compelled to resign his seat of the council of the Chamber of Commerce. He was president of the Bristol Corn Trade Association, and in this capacity was able, from his grasp of business topics, making effective speeches, and the address which he used to deliver at the corn trade annual dinner [UNCLEAR]... listened to with the respect due to the [UNCLEAR] of an expert. He had for many years suffered from serious malady, for a time going abroad in the hope that change of scene might benefit him. He was, however, doomed to disappointment, and at length relinquished commercial transactions and went to reside at Fairholme, Eastfield Park, Weston-super-Mare. For upwards of a month he had been confined to his house where, although the utmost medical skill was available, he sank gradually, and expired on Tuesday by a coincidence upon his birthday, he being then 59 years of age. He leaves a widow and six children.\r\nOur Weston correspondent writes:- Mr Lane had been in failing health for a year or more, but he only became seriously ill a few months ago. The deceased gentleman came to Weston about three years ago, and he and his family became members of the Church Road Wesleyan Chapel. During his connection therewith he took a deep interest in all matters affecting the welfare of the church and was a liberal supporter of all branches of the work. He was appointed a trustee, and he represented the church on the Weston-super-Mare Free Church Council. Mr Lane was likewise a local preacher, and manifested considerable interest in the George Street Mission Chapel, and frequently conducted the services there on Sunday evenings. He was a warm supporter of the Y.M.C.A., took a great interest in local affairs, and had been approached with a view to his becoming a candidate for a seat on the Urban District Council.\r\n\r\nYesterday, at Bristol police court, the Chairman (Mr Hosegood), said that before the commencement of the ordinary business of the court he should like to make allusion to a brother magistrate who had passed away on the previous day, Mr W. Lane. He was a great friend of his (the speaker's) and had been connected with him in business for 40 years. He was also known in the city as a very capable man of business. He gave a good deal of his time to city matters, being some years on the Town Council for St. Michael's; for some years a member of the Chamber of Commerce; and, he believed, once its president; and for some few years s magistrate on that bench. He was quite sure they all felt deep sympathy with the widow and children. Mr H. H. Gore, speaking on behalf of the solicitors, said he had had not only the privileged of being in the Town Council with Mr Lane for some years, but had often stood before him in that court room. He would therefore like to express the deep sense of regret the profession would feel at Mr Lane's untimely death. He had always treated them with courtesy, kindness, and patience.",
13/05/1897,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Henry Hodder,"DEATH OF MR HENRY HODDER\r\n\r\nIt is with regret we have to announce the death of Mr Henry Hodder, which took place yesterday, after a long illness, at his residence Carlton House, Woodland Road, Tyndall's Park. For many years Mr Hodder was a well known figure in Broad Street, where for over forty years he had been associated with the chemist's and drug stores which bear his name. To him is due the establishment of the drug store system in Bristol, for he was the first chemist who commenced to sell at prices below those which had ruled so long in the trade. Mr Hodder was a keen man of business, with a distinct personality, and in the early years of his trading he succeeded in drawing attention to himself and his shop by the novel and peculiar style of his system of advertising. He was a good judge of pictures and china, of which he acquired a valuable collection. The late Mr Hodder was born January 9th, 1819, and shortly after leaving school he went on a voyage to the Isle of France and Calcutta. He returned in 1834, and was apprenticed to his brother, who carried on business in Love Street, Hotwells. Afterwards he became an assistant to Mr Capper, chemist, Corn Street, and in 1846 he commenced business for himself on St. Michael's Hill, but in 1853 he removed to Broad Street, disposing of his St. Michael's Hill business to Mr Maish. It was in Broad Street that the late Mr Hodder became the pioneer of the cash chemist or drug store system. It was only natural that an innovation of a character which threatened to seriously disturb the system upon which the chemist and druggist's business had been hitherto conducted, should meet with keen criticism, but Mr Hodder adhered to the system he had initiated,and he lived long enough to see it extended to nearly all parts of the kingdom. In 1887 his business was taken over by a company, which has proved very successful under the management of Mr E. Carpenter, who succeeded his father in the control of the concern. The directors of the company comprised the late Mr Hodder, Mr H. R. Wansbrough, Mr E. Carpenter (managing director), and Mr H. W. Carter (chairman). When the company was formed Mr Hodder dealt out liberal treatment to those who had been in his employ, and Â£5000 worth of shares - representing one-fifth of the capital - was allotted between fourteen and fifteen of his chief assistants on the condition that they remained seven years with the company. The deceased leaves a widow and several daughters, two sons by a former wife, one in Australia.",
07/03/1895,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr E. N. P. Moor,"DEATH OF MR E N. P. MOOR\r\n\r\nClifton College sustained a severe loss yesterday by the death, at the early age of forty-three, of Mr E. N. P. Moor, who had for more than twenty years been an assistant master, and since 1892 a House Master at the College. Mr Moor, who was a son of Rev. J. H. Moor, of Kingsbridge, Devonshire, was an old Cliftonian. He entered the school with a scholarship in May, 1867, and in September, 1868, attained the position of head of the school, holding this until, in October, 1870,  he proceeded with a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford. He was distinguished in athletics as well as scholarship at the college, and in 1869 and 1870 was a member of the school cricket eleven. At Oxford he distinguished himself by gaining a first class in classical Moderations and a second class Final Schools, and after taking his degree he was invited by the Rev. J. Percival to return to Clifton as assistant master. In the twenty years that have elapsed, Mr Moor has devoted all his energies to the promotion of the interests of the school. He was one of the secretaries of the Building Fund, and his continued interest in athletics was shown in his contribution of the historical chapter on sports to the Clifton College Register. As a form and house master, he has gained in a very notable degree the respect and affection of colleagues and pupils, and the news of his untimely death will create deep sorrow wherever old Cliftonians are to be found. For many years Mr Moor was engaged as a classical tutor to the sixth form, and he was largely responsible for the classical scholarships and honours gained by Cliftonians at the universities. Mr Moor was attacked with influenza soon after the commencement of the present term, and pneumonia developing, his condition had been critical for some weeks, death occurring yesterday morning. Mr Moor, who was a member of the National Liberal Club, and often attended the dinners of the Anchor Society, had little time for engagements unconnected with school work. But he took an active interest in the Clifton High School for Girls, of which he was one of the governing body. Mr Moor leaves a widow and two daughters.",
09/06/1896,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Henry Crisp,"DEATH OF MR H. CRISP\r\n\r\nThe death of Mr Henry Crisp (of the firm of Messrs Crisp and Oatley) removes one who had long occupied an important professional position in this locality, and who had been architect of many undertakings of considerable magnitude in various parts of the land. The deceased gentleman was a son of the Rev. Thomas S. Crisp, a former president of the Baptist College, Stoke Croft. He was articled to the late Mr Thomas Foster, architect, in the year 1845, and commencing practice on the expiration of his articles, was very soon successful in many competitions. Pilning Church was built from his designs, and Stonehouse Church and that fine edifice, St. Cuthbert's, Wells, underwent alterations under his care. He subsequently entered into partnership with Mr E. W. Godwin, and together they carried out many important works, amongst others Glenbeigh Towers, an important residence in Ireland. In the  competition for the Guildhall, Bristol, the firm submitted three designs, and were awarded all three premiums, first, second and third; neither plan, however, represented the Guildhall as we know it today, for after a great deal of controversy over the subject, the work passed into other hands. Amongst local matters in which Mr Crisp's firm was concerned were the considerable extension and new administration department at Bristol Lunatic Asylum, the nurses' home, and new wards at the General Hospital, police stations at Bedminster and Redland, and show rooms and factories of the Bristol Wagon Works. Many big business premises and vicarages have been erected from the deceased gentleman's designs, and the restoration of that well-known landmark, Dundry Church tower, was entrusted to him. In 1888 he took into partnership Mr G. H. Oatley, who had been associated with him since 1879, and in 1894, the firm, in conjunction with Mr W. S. Skinner, won an important competition for a lunatic asylum for 2000 patients at Winwick, in Lancashire, for which the estimated cost is over a quarter of a million. This work is still in progress. Mr Crisp was a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects, and was on the Council of the Institute. Until a month or two ago he was president of the Bristol Society of Architects, but owing to failing health he resigned that position. His strength gradually weakened, and very early yesterday morning, at the age of 70, he passed away. Personally he was a man of kindly disposition, who won much respect, and professionally was known not only for his architectural work, but for the accuracy of his estimates as to the probable cost of enterprises upon which he was called to give an opinion. His death took place at his residence, 26, West Park, Clifton.",
20/02/1896,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr George Nichols,"DEATH OF MR GEORGE NICHOLS\r\n\r\nThe announcement of the death of Mr George Nichols, which took place yesterday, occasioned both regret and surprise in Bristol. It was not generally known that he was critically ill, although for several months he had been missed from Broad Street, where his firm, Messrs George Nichols, Smith, and Alder, have their offices and saleroom, and from the business circles where his tall form was familiar, and his professional ability recognised by all. Early in life Mr Nichols entered upon the agricultural training which stood him in such good stead throughout an honoured career. He became a student at the Royal Agricultural College at Cirencester, securing his diploma in 1850, and later in life he entered upon farming upon a considerable scale. He was one of the oldest tenants of Sir Greville Smyth, having held a farm at Ashton under Sir Greville for many years. With a desire to further extend his agricultural experience the deceased gentleman, about 15 or 16 years ago, took a large farm in Wiltshire, and continued to successfully carry out the undertaking for ten years, releasing the farm a few years ago. As a valuer and authority upon agricultural matters his name stood high, and was known and respected throughout the West of England. His practical experience gave him exceptional fitness for dealing with much of the business which passed through his hands. He was not one who courted public life, and although on several occasions invited to become associated with public bodies in the city he never would consent to be nominated for public service. He, however, was connected with the Bath and West of England and Royal Shows, and when the exhibitions of these societies were held in Bristol on different occasions he was active in his efforts to secure the success of the exhibitions. In politics Mr Nichols was a Conservative, and was a member of the Dolphin Society committee, but he was not often seen in a prominent political position. He began business in Bristol as an auctioneer and valuer 30 years ago. About four years later Mr Alder became associated in the business, and 12 years ago was taken into partnership. During later years Mr George Nichols, jun., joined the firm, and still more recently Mr Moses Smith became a partner. Mr George Nichols, although having the assistance of experienced partners, remained something more than the figurehead of the concern, and until last autumn he was frequent in attendance at his office. An affection of the heart had troubled him for several years, and he had been lately ailing. He, however, felt well enough to leave his bedroom during the latter part of last week, but a relapse set in on Monday morning, and his illness proved fatal at half-past ten o'clock yesterday morning. Mr Nichols was 67 years of age. The funeral will take place at Long Ashton on Saturday afternoon at half-past three.",
25/04/1898,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Dr Henry Marshall,"DEATH OF DR MARSHALL\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death of Mr. Henry Marshall, who passed away early yesterday morning, at his residence, 28, Caledonia Place, Clifton. A short time ago he took cold, and afterwards influenza developed, followed by pneumonia, which proved fatal. The sad event was referred to at the Church of All Saints, Clifton where deceased for some years acted as sidesman, by the Rev. H. B. Bromby, vicar, and the announcement cast a gloom over the congregation. The Bishop of Bristol, preaching yesterday morning at St. Nicholas' Church, also referred to the death of Dr Marshall. The Dean, preaching at the Cathedral, last night, likewise adverted to the subject.\r\nThe father of the deceased was a clergyman of Bristol, very popular among the Evangelical party. He had originally been a Presbyterian, but afterwards entered the Church of England. Dr Marshall obtained the rudiments of his medical education at the Bristol Medical School, where he had the advantage of obtaining much valuable knowledge from Dr J. G. Swayne, the then lecturer. Afterwards he proceeded to Edinburgh University where he studied under Mr Syme, the celebrated surgeon, and no doubt the instruction he thus received led to his practising for a time in surgical cases. Sir James Simpson, who introduced the use of chloroform, was a lecturer at the University while young Marshall remained there. Ether had been first employed as an anaesthetic by a dentist in America, but the Scotch claim the discovery of chloroform. Dr Marshall obtained considerable repute at Edinburgh, and having become qualified as a physician and surgeon, he practised in the latter capacity in Bristol, where he was successful in obtaining an appointment at the General Hospital in competition with Mr Corbould. At an early period of his career he travelled in Russia, and was greatly interested in the manners and occupations of the inhabitants. Having been a surgeon in this city for ten or twelve years, he ceased his connection with the General Hospital, save that he was appointed consulting surgeon to the institution, and practised henceforth as a physician. He ranked highly in his profession, though on one occasion he became involved in litigation through having with Dr Shaw signed a certificate of lunacy against a lady who brought an action which was tried at Bristol assize before Mr Justice Fields. A verdict was returned in favour of both defendants, and so strongly were the sympathies of the medical profession aroused in their behalf that a subscription was set on foot through the United Kingdom to recoup those gentlemen for the heavy costs they had incurred.\r\nTo many persons, not merely in Bristol, but in the country at large, the career of Dr. Marshall will be of interest on account of the prominent position he held in connection with the English Church Union, as he was president of the local branch. For a long period he remained a consistent supporter of the services at St. Raphael, and engaged the warm friendship of the Rev. A. H. Ward, the vicar. When the church of All Saints was advocated in Pembroke Road, Dr Marshall took an active share in the movement. A new parish was carved out of St. John's, Redland, a large number of earnest men desiring a free and open church, the subject dear to their hearts having been discussed in the drawing-room of Mr Todd Walton, and it may be news to some that in August, 1864, the incumbency of All Saints' was offered to and accepted by the Rev. H. W. Sargent, incumbent of St. John the Baptist, Oxford. Ill health obliged him to resign the post, which was afterwards filled by the Rev. R. W. Randall, vicar of Lavington, Sussex. Throughout the many years of Mr Randall's incumbency, Dr Marshall was prominent among those who were officially connected with All Saints, among his colleagues being Dr J. G. Swayne, Messrs Todd Walton, W. Harrington Bush, W. Glennie Smith, Furster Alleyne, Meyrick Heath, and Lieut-Colonel Archer. At first he joined the choir, but not feeling satisfied with his vocal attainment, he ceased to be a member. Upon the preferment of the Rev. R. W. Randall to be Dean of Chichester it seemed appropriate that Dr Marshall should take a leading part in the farewell meeting, and at a gathering in All Saints' Hall, held on April 21st, 1891, he stated that he was present at the laying of the foundation-stone of the church and at the consecration, so as one of the few surviving members of the Building Committee there was some fitness in his speaking of the generous benefits they had received through their first vicar. At the time All Saints was opened there were but two churches in Bristol - St. John's, Bedminster, and St. Raphael's - at which full church privileges were to be had. From the beginning of the church to the close of 1890, as proof of the manner in which the Rev. R. W. Randall's services were appreciated, the free will offerings had amounted to a sum little short of Â£100,000. This showed how deeply his teaching had taken hold of the people. Socially Dr Marshall was much esteemed, and he was proud of the fact that he was a Scotchman his speeches when president of the local Caledonian Society and the Burns Clubs at their anniversary dinners being replete with laudation of Scotland and Scotchmen in admirably delivered addresses. He was active and generally enjoyed good health, so that the intelligence of his decease after a short illness came to the citizens with a feeling of painful surprise. He leaves a wife and children, his son cultivating a tea plantation in Ceylon. Sympathy with the bereaved family will be felt throughout the city generally. The Dean, in his sermon last night, said he could not trust himself to speak at length on the great loss which Bristol and Clifton had sustained through the death early that morning of Dr Marshall. He would, however, ask the congregation to remember in their prayers those whom he had left behind - his widow and children. It was hard to think that the ties which had been formed could no more be united on earth, and well might it be said with the poet Tennyson-\r\n\r\nO for the touch of a vanished hand,\r\nAnd the sound of a voice that is still.\r\n\r\nYet the thought that the death of a dear one was certainly the ushering in to renewed loves and revived friendships was a consolation, and the prayer of those who were left behind should be that their Christian life should not become listless and impracticable, but full of active work for the Master - which in some degree would prove an antidote to the tendency to morbidness felt after the loss of a dear one, and God himself would give tokens of His presence to those who persevered in work for Him. Canon Tetley also referred to Dr Marshall's death at the morning service in the Cathedral.",
29/12/1896,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr George Frederick Schacht,"THE LATE MR G. F. SCHACHT\r\n\r\nThe death of Mr George Frederick Schacht, which as already been announced in our obituary column, occurred very suddenly, and removed one who was very well known in Bristol and Clifton. Mr Schacht was a chemist who for a long while carried on business in Regent Street, Clifton, and took a prominent part in movements connected with the Pharmaceutical Society. For twenty-five years he was a member of its council, and on his retirement from that office last autumn he was presented with an address acknowledging the useful work done in connection with that organisation. The presentation was made by Mr Charles Townsend, and the opportunity was taken to bear testimony to the high esteem Mr Schacht had won in this district. He had been vice-chairman of the society, and also a member of the examining body, pharmaceutical education being a matter in which he evinced the keenest interest. The address, which was numerously signed, was in the following terms:- 'We, the members and friends, whose names are attached hereto, beg your acceptance of this address on the occasion of your retirement from the Council of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain after an unbroken service of 25 years. We heartily congratulate you and ourselves on this long period of active work in the varied capacities of member of the Council, member of the board of examiners, and vice-president. We gratefully acknowledge the ability and energy with which you have increasingly served the best interests of pharmacy, as well as the zeal and perseverance which have always marked your efforts in the cause of pharmaceutical education. Moreover, we especially recognise the high personal qualities and hearty devotion which have always been at the command of our Bristol Association. Though your more public labours may now be ended, we rejoice to know that you will continue to dwell in our midst; and, assuring you of our sincere esteem and regard, we venture to hope that your sympathy and co-operation may still be accorded to us for many years to come.' Fourteen years ago Mr Schacht's business was amalgamated with that of Mr Giles, and since that time Mr Schacht has not been personally concerned in the retail part of the undertaking, and has had more time to devote to other objects. One of these was the Bristol University College, of which he was hon. treasurer; at the recent annual meeting of the governors he spoke in terms of eulogy of the chemical work done at the institution, selecting this special mention because it was the department on which his life's work especially qualified him to pronounce an opinion. He appeared to be in his usual health on Christmas Day, but on Saturday morning did not make his appearance as usual, and was found sitting in his room death. His widow survives him. The death occurred at his residence, 1, Windsor Terrace, Clifton; Mr Schacht was 73 years of age, and his unexpected decease occasioned widespread regret. The funeral will take place on Wednesday afternoon at Portbury.",
27/02/1896,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr William Henry Cowlin,"DEATH OF MR W. H. COWLIN\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death of Mr W. H. Cowlin, one of the Councillors of St. Paul's Ward and the senior member of the well-known firm of builders in Stratton Street and Meadow Street. Mr Cowlin, not long after attaining his majority, had the responsibility of succeeding his respected father in the  control of the business, but he was well qualified to do this, for he had exceptional technological knowledge of the various branches of the building trade. He had not merely the practical experience which a busy man would gain in the daily exercise of his vocation, but he had made a study of the theoretical principles underlying his trade, and at the Technology Classes of the Merchant Venturers' Technical College won distinctions proving how apt he was a student. His father's death occurred in the autumn of 1891, and since that period, with his two brothers, who were also associated with the firm, he has carried out many important building works. The restoration of the Mayor's Chapel was one undertaking which required very careful treatment, and more recently there was the renovation of the central tower of the Bristol Cathedral, the restoration of the beautiful Lady Chapel, and other work connected with the sacred edifice. In such matters as these Mr W. H. Cowlin won the esteem of those who came into contact with him. While the meeting of the National Benevolent Institution was being held yesterday afternoon under the presidency of the Mayor of Bristol, the Dean (Dr. Pigon) asked leave to mention the critical stage which Mr Cowlin's illness had then reached, remarking that in an assembly of Bristolians he was sure an interest would be felt in one so well known and respected as he was. At the Cathedral, added the Dean, Mr Cowlin was very much valued, and it was a matter for the deepest regret that so sad an illness had overtaken him. Mr Cowlin was a member of the committee of the Bristol Master Builders' Association, and was also connected with the national organisation, one of whose meetings he attended with Mr H. J. Spear, as lately as January 22nd. On that occasion Mr Cowlin spoke upon the Plumbers' Registration Bill, a subject in which he felt a deep interest and upon which several years ago he gave evidence he gave evidence before a Select Committee of the House of Commons. In politics he was an ardent Liberal. He was interested in Rugby football, and when married, only 18 months ago, the Bristol club made him a wedding present and joined heartily in the numerous good wishes then expressed for his future happiness. His connection with the Bristol Town Council dates from November last, and his last public duty was to attend the Council meeting on February 11th. He was then feeling unwell, and was obliged to leave the meeting before the agenda had been completed. As his illness progressed he was found to be suffering from typhoid fever, and upon this pneumonia supervened. Throughout yesterday it was known that his condition was well  nigh hopeless and late in the evening came the tidings of his decease. Personally Mr Cowlin was of a kindly and genial disposition and although young in years (we believe he was about 28) he had in his brief career shown himself possessed of qualities which make his loss to the city a real one. He leaves a widow and an infant child, born a couple of months ago.",
24/04/1896,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Joseph Tanner,"DEATH OF MR JOSEPH TANNER\r\n\r\nWe regret to record the death of Mr Joseph Tanner, J.P., which occurred at nine o'clock yesterday morning at his residence, Madeley House, Pembroke Road, Clifton. Mr Tanner, who would have completed his 61st year next Monday, has been suffering for some months from an affection of the heart, which confined him to the house. A week ago his condition became critical, and he gradually lapsed into unconsciousness, never rallying again. Mr Tanner was best known as head of the firm of Butler and Tanner, of the Selwood Printing Works, Frome. It was in the year 1863 that he joined Mr Butler in the printing business with which he was for the rest of his life associated. At that time the firm only employed 30 workpeople. Gradually, owing in a great measure to the business acumen of Mr Tanner, the undertaking grew until it came to be regarded as the pioneer of book-printing works out of London. So largely has the establishment increased that 450 workpeople are now employed there. Mr Butler retired in 1870, and Mr Tanner conducted the business alone until twelve months ago, when the management was transferred to two of his sons, Mr R. R. Tanner and Mr L. Tanner. Both in Frome and in Bristol Mr Tanner was a well-known public man. In Frome he was chairman of the Local Board, chairman of the Technical Education Committee, a member of the Board of Guardians, and chairman of the Assessment Committee. He was also a justice of the peace for the county of Somerset. He was a Congregationalist, and was long connected with Zion Chapel, Frome, where he was a deacon, and secretary of the Sunday school, besides rendering valuable help in other departments of church work. In 1881 he was elected chairman of the Executive of the Wilts and Somerset Congregational Union, and he only retired from this position a short time ago. For several years he was a deacon at Highbury Chapel, Bristol, where he was also appointed superintendent of the Sunday school and secretary of the church meeting. On the death of Mr Josiah Williams he was elected treasurer of the church. He was a generous supporter of the London Missionary Society, of which he was a director. He was president of the Totterdown branch of the Young Men's Christian Association, and was associated with many other religious and philanthropic movements and institutions. In politics he was a Liberal up to the split in 1886, when he refrained from supporting Mr Gladstone's Home Rule policy. He leaves a widow, four sons, and two daughters. One of his sons, Mr Joseph R. Tanner, is a fellow and lecturer at St. John's College, Cambridge. Mr E. R. Tanner is a member of the firm of Pomeroy, Tanner, and Pomeroy, solicitors, of Bristol. The other two sons are connected with the Selwood printing works undertaking. Mr Tanner's brother is the English chaplain at Florence. The funeral is fixed for next Monday.",
07/04/1917,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr John Ryan Bennett,"DEATH OF MR J. R. BENNETT\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death, which took place yesterday, of Mr John Ryan Bennett, J.P., of 3, Upper Belgrave Road, Clifton, at the age of 70 years. He left his home in the morning to attend service at Highbury Chapel, as was his custom, and persons who saw him say he appeared in good health. He suddenly fell, however, when walking up Cotham Hill, and though assistance was speedily obtained, it proved unavailing. In the summer of 1911 Mr Bennett met with a serious accident in London, falling whilst stepping off a tram car and fracturing his skull. For many days his life was in considerable danger, and his health was affected for a long period, but of late he seemed to have gradually improved, though much of his old vigour was lacking.\r\nMr J. R. Bennett was very well known in Bristol, and as the head of various colliery concerns for many years he had a close connection with the commerce of the city. His association with colliery work arose from the fact that his father, Mr Henry Bennett, J.P., became the owner of the Dean Lane Pit, business being carried on under the title of the Bedminster Coal Company. Mr Henry Bennett made Bedminster his home, residing at Rock Cottage, a house standing in grounds fronting West Street, and he was prominent in the control of the little chapel standing not far away. In Bedminster Mr John Ryan Bennett was born, and as a boy he attended this place of worship. After being privately educated, in older years he was of great assistance to his father in the colliery work. Eventually he became the manager of the Dean Lane Pit. He was thoroughly conversant with work underground, and when accidents occurred he was always ready to lead in the work of rescue and investigation. His daring in his younger days was such that Mr Brough, who was then H.M. Mining Inspector for this area, once advised him, in the presence of the writer of this biographical notice, to take more care for his own safety.\r\nUpon the death of his father, Mr John Ryan Bennett became head of the Bedminster Coal Company, and so continued until the exhaustion of the more accessible seams led to the pit being closed. The immense mound of shale which marked its many decades of activity was got rid of partly by being hauled elsewhere, and the site, which had reverted to Lady Smyth, was presented by her to the city as a play ground for children. Meanwhile Mr R. R. Bennett found a larger outlet for his energies.  The death of Mr Handel Cossham left his collieries on the eastern side of Bristol in the hands of his trustees, and these gentlemen were agreeably surprised when a company, of which Mr J. R. Bennett was the head, purchased at a price which rendered the Cossham Memorial [unclear] a financially practicable scheme. The mining adventure proved a difficult task, and for a time the pits had to be closed, but eventually they were reopened by a new company, Mr Bennett and his brother (Mr A. H. Bennett) being associated with the undertaking. Mr Bennett possessed exceptional knowledge of coal mining in the Bristol district, and gave interesting evidence before the Royal Commission appointed some years ago to inquire into the probable duration of our coal supplies.\r\nMr Bennett became a member of the Council of the South Wales Institute of Engineers,and in 1891-92 held the office of President of the Bristol Chamber of Commerce. As in so many other instances, this position proved an introduction to municipal service, and in 1892 he was returned as a member for Westbury Ward, and was placed upon the Docks and Museum Committees. He retained his position in the municipal body for several terms, and in 1894 was chosen as a justice of the peace. He also became one of the directors of the Bristol and South Wales Permanent Building Society. While still closely connected with the colliery industry at Bedminster, he identified himself with religious work at Zion Congregational Chapel, and afterwards, having joined the church at Highbury, was chosen as one of the deacons there. He interested himself in the operations of the Congregational Council, and was chosen as its treasurer. He Mr Bennett, who was married, leaves several sons and daughters. He was a man of genial disposition and had a large circle of friends.",
14/09/1893,Western Daily Press,Obituary,General James Daubeny,"DEATH OF GENERAL DAUBENY\r\n\r\nIt is with much regret that we have to record the death of General James Daubeny, C.B., which occurred at his residence, Tower House, Manilla Road, Clifton, yesterday morning somewhat suddenly from heart disease. The deceased officer, who was in his 67th year, had a distinguished career in the army. He joined in 1845, in his 18th year, and went through the Crimean War with the 62nd Foot, now known as the 1st Battalion of the Wiltshire Regiment. He was at the siege of Sebastopol, and in the course of the campaign gained very quick promotion. He commanded the regiment at the desperate attack on the Redan in June, and again at the second attack in September. He was slightly wounded during the campaign, and was on more than one occasion mentioned in despatches for personal bravery. For his services in the fighting around the Redan he received a medal and clasp, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He also received the Turkish medal, and was further decorated with the order of the Medjidie, besides being made a knight of the French Legion of Honour. Subsequently he held a command in India. In 1881 he retired, however, the position of honorary colonel of the Yorkshire Light Infantry, of which regiment the 1st Battalion (formerly the 51st Foot) is stationed at Guernsey, and the 2nd Battalion (formerly the 105th Foot) is stationed at Bombay. On his retirement General Daubeny took up his residence in Clifton, where he lent his aid in the management of the Bristol Emigration Society and other benevolent societies. His principal public services, however, since his retirement, have been rendered in connection with the Barton Regis Board of Guardians, of which body he had been a member for nearly ten years.",
06/02/1897,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr William Gibbons,"DEATH OF MR WILLIAM GIBBONS\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death of Mr William Gibbons, which occurred yesterday morning at an early hour at his residence, Grafton Villa, Arley Hill. About three years ago Mr Gibbons had a serious illness, and although he managed to pull through, his heart became affected. Since then his health at times has been very precarious. He was taken ill last Wednesday, and in spite of medical aid expired as stated, the cause of death being heart disease. Mr Gibbons had been for many years a prominent member of the Wesleyan body in the city, and it was in connection with that society that he for many years laboured in the Baptist Mills Circuit Chapel. Some difficulties arising here, he subsequently devoted his untiring energy to the Brookland Church in Lower Ashley Road, and mainly by his endeavours this place of worship was raised, the funds being forthcoming in surprisingly quick fashion. He was also largely interested in the publication of a special book of Wesley's hymns, believing that such a work should always be procurable at little above cost price, but this hymnal subsequently fell into disuse through the compilation of another book from a different source. A great deal of his time was spent in the interest of the children, for whom he always showed a sympathetic thoughtfulness, and for a long time he had a large choir of young people whom he directed, and by means of the tonic sol-fa notation they were able to perform a number of the better-known oratorios at the Colston Hall, Mr Gibbons himself acting as the conductor of these enjoyable concerts. His interest, too, in Sunday School work was exceedingly keen, and whilst connected with Baptist Mills Sunday Schools the membership was exceptionally large as far as the circuit was concerned. The deceased gentleman, although formerly a Liberal, was of recent years a Unionist, and assisted the candidature of Mr Lewis Fry, M.P. in Bristol North, his aid in the district of Baptist Mills ranking as a great loss to the Liberal party. Mr Gibbons took an active interest in municipal affairs. For many years he held a responsible position at Messrs H. H. and S. Budgett and Co., wholesale grocers, Nelson Street, being well known in the markets of the north; but he subsequently went into business with Mr Sinnock, his brother-in-law, who, however, afterwards started in Baldwin Street, whilst Mr Gibbons then traded as Messrs Gibbons and Co., at Counterslip. The deceased gentleman was much esteemed by all classes, and was 62 years of age.",

Gibson, one of the councillors for the Clifton Ward of the city of Bristol, which occurred very suddenly, at his residence, 2, Worcester Villas, Clifton, yesterday morning. Mr Gibson, who was a barrister practising on the Western Circuit, lunched with the High Sheriff on Friday, and at the function received a slight chill, which kept him in the house on Saturday. He took to his bed on Sunday, and was attended by Dr. Tivy, but the indisposition was not considered to be of a serious nature. On Monday evening he was apparently better, and when last seen, about eleven o'clock, he appeared to be progressing favourably, and was in good spirits. Yesterday morning at six o'clock, the family and inmates of the house were startled by the intelligence that he had been found dead in bed, death having been due to apoplexy.

He was educated at Clifton College and graduated at Oxford, being afterwards called to the bar. He was elected as a councillor for the Clifton Ward in November, 1890, with Mr C. J. C. Prichard. Last year he was made president of the Grateful Society, and his term of office would not have expired until November next.

02/11/1895,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Benjamin Spry Stock,"DEATH OF MR B. S. STOCK\r\n\r\nWe regret to state that Mr Benjamin Spry Stock, president of Bristol Stock Exchange, expired yesterday morning at Colwyn Bay, North Wales. The deceased gentleman, who had attained an advanced age, left the city some weeks ago for a holiday, but he became unwell, and his illness assumed a serious aspect. Last week he appeared to be improving but had a relapse. Mr Stock was a member of an old Bristol family, and a relative of Sir Edward S. Hill, M.P. His brother, Mr Edward Stock, acted for some year as sword bearer, and is connected with the sugar trade. The earliest minutes of the Bristol Stock Exchange show that in 1845 an association was in existence which afterwards developed into the Stock Exchange, and Sir J. K. Haberfield was president. In September of that year the deceased was elected a member, and among his colleagues were Sir George Edwards, Mr Robert Goss, Mr J. N. Morcom, Mr J. Kempson Thomas, and other citizens of good position. After the death of Mr Augustus F. Morcom, in 1885, Mr B. S. Stock was elected president, and at each subsequent annual meeting he was re-elected. His son, Mr Spry Stock, was associated with him in business as stockbrokers in Small Street Court, where the firm is known as Stock and Co. The deceased was not connected with many local undertakings. He became one of the original directors of the Bristol and West of England Building Society, but his connection with that society did not last long.

15/08/1889,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Frederick Terrell,"DEATH OF MR FREDERICK TERRELL\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death of Mr Frederick Terrell, which took place at his residence, 83, Pembroke Road, Clifton, yesterday morning. His decease was not unexpected, he having been dangerously ill for some time, and lay unconscious for some days before his death. Deceased, who was 85 years of age, had been living for some time in retirement, but down to 1883 he took an active part in municipal life in Bristol, and served the city as one of its representatives in the Town Council for the long period of 36 years. Mr Terrell was by profession a surgeon, and formerly practised in Charlotte Street, Queen Street. He entered the Town Council in 1847 as one of the representatives for Bedminster, and he sat for that ward down to 1880. In that year the Alteration of Wards Act came into operation and, Bedminster being divided, Mr Terrell was elected without opposition for the western portion. In 1883 he retired from the council, and since then he has taken no part in public matters. Mr Terrell was a member of the old Local Board, and he filled the office of chairman of the Sanitary Committee for a considerable number of years, having been succeeded in that office by Mr C. H. Low.

06/03/1895,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Sir Joseph Weston,"SIR JOSEPH WESTON\r\n\r\nThe phenomenally severe weather, which has been fatal to so many people, has added to its victims a justly-respected citizen of Bristol, who obtained at the hands of his fellow citizens the highest honour it was in their power to bestow, and whose services to the community amongst which he lived were recognised by the Sovereign by the bestowal of a knighthood. Sir Joseph Weston was spared a long illness. It is but a few days ago that he was attending, with his customary devotion to his duties as a member of Parliament, and he was so regular and vigilant in the discharge of these duties, and, notwithstanding his age, they appeared to have so little prejudicial effect upon his health, that the announcement of his death, after a very short illness, has taken everyone by surprise. It is not too much to say that if he had lived he could have remained the unchallenged member for East Bristol as long as he cared to occupy the position. Those who were in political sympathy with him watched, with great approval, his perfect reliability in support of his political leaders, and the conscientious way in which he made his political work the chief object of his life. And those who did not share his political views recognised in 1892, and were prepared to recognise again, that his political consistency and his personal popularity gave him an unassailable position in the great working-class constituency that he had represented since 1890.\r\nIn some respects his life was typical rather than extraordinary.  There have been, and there are, many men who, by courage and insight in business matters, have acquired wealth and opportunities of public usefulness, and who have had the desire and the capacity to make the most of these opportunities. The history of our great municipalities has been largely made by such men. It is not, as a rule, the man who inherits leisure who best serves the public; it is, on the contrary, the man whose natural energy has been exercised and disciplined in his business pursuits, and whose legitimate success has made his fellow citizens feel that he can be safely entrusted with public responsibilities. Nor did the late Sir Joseph Weston wait until he had ceased to be a busy man before placing his services at the disposal of the public. His public work commenced thirty years ago, when he was in vigorous middle age, and for about twenty years he was a highly valued member of the Bristol Council. The confidence felt in his judgment was not due simply to the fact of his business capacity and success. Many men who succeed in business are the reverse of successful when acting with others. But Sir Joseph Weston had above all, the supreme quality of tact. He was, within the limits to which his opportunities were confined, a first class 'man of affairs'. As a Mayor, he was best known to the citizens by the liberality and dignity with which he discharged the more public duties of that position, but his talents were still more strikingly displayed in the skill and adroitness with which he presided over deliberations that concerned difficult and controversial business, and when it was decided that the city should, by purchasing the docks at Avonmouth and Portishead, end a struggle that was threatening in the words of the late Mr Brice, to bring ruin to the vanquished and sorrow to the victor, no praise could be too high for the industry, patience, good temper, and tact with which the Mayor carried out the delicate negotiations entrusted to him. It was, in great part, owing to the deep impression he had made as Mayor for four years that so strong a feeling was created that he should be the candidate of his party for the representation of the city in Parliament. A consistent, but not a prominent, supporter of Liberalism previously, Sir Joseph Weston devoted himself to his new duties with characteristic fidelity, and his natural kindliness of disposition and absence of anything like angularity of temperament preserved to him to the very end of his life the goodwill and respect of all with whom he was brought in contact.\r\nIn recalling Sir Joseph Weston's career it will appear to many that its distinguishing feature was not that he was a faithful and self-sacrificing supporter of the political principles in which he believed, but that he was a good citizen. This was, indeed, a phrase he was fond of. He was in the habit of telling the persons who were sworn in before him as freemen of the city, and who smiled at the archaic terms of the oath they had to take, that the spirit of the promise was that they would be good citizens. And his own sense of the duties that devolved upon him as a good citizen was not merely shown by devoting an enormous amount of time and trouble to the financial business of the city.\r\nHis very prominent share in the establishment of public libraries in this city will be recollected, and he was ready to associate himself with all movements that appeared likely to add to the happiness of the people and the welfare of the city. But he was always sincerely anxious that Bristol should be prosperous. There was nothing he more insisted upon in his speeches on municipal matters than the need of Bristol securing an export trade in order for the import trade to be properly developed, and his efforts to secure such a trade were supplemented  by his active work as a director of two great manufacturing concerns situated in the district which he subsequently represented in Parliament. He believed in the city and port. He was not guilty of that strange but too prevalent habit of depreciating the trade and prospects of the place - a habit which when noticed by traders in other places creates a false and mischievous impression. A successful man, yet he made no enemies; a very wealthy man yet he represented, with general approval, a  thoroughly working-class constituency; a firm Liberal, he was esteemed by his political opponents; a very busy man, and he found time to serve the public with singular efficiency. When all this can be truthfully said about any man it follows that he was a good citizen and a man of no ordinary qualities. And, hence, both as a citizen and as a man, Sir Joseph Weston's memory will be honoured by all classes.",
06/12/1872,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Robert Charleton,"DEATH OF MR ROBERT CHARLETON\r\n\r\nYesterday morning Mr Robert Charleton, whose benevolence has made his name a household word in this locality, died at his residence, Ashley Hill. The event was to a certain degree sudden, although Mr Charleton had for some years been suffering from a complaint which affected his face, and about two years since suffered considerably from it. He was still able to transact business, and until within the last few days was not confined to his house. About the beginning of the present week he was taken more seriously ill, and yesterday morning died from the effects of the malady which had so long afflicted him. Mr Charleton, who was sixty three years of age, was one of three sons of Mr James Charleton, a gentleman who formerly resided in this city. The two other sons met with a fatal boating accident near the mouth of the river. The surviving son, Mr Robert Charleton, as is well known in the neighbourhood, was a member of the Society of Friends; but his liberality of thought caused him to extend his benevolence far beyond the circle of a single sect. He often presided at meetings connected with other religious denominations, whilst his donations to help any cause in which he felt interested were frequent and sometimes munificent. For some years he carried on a manufactory at Two Mile Hill, at which he employed several hundred people, and he kept it on to his own disadvantage for some time, rather than cause those persons to be deprived of their means of support. In his private life he was greatly esteemed for his thorough simplicity and kindliness of heart. He used to express himself as obliged to anyone who brought a deserving case of necessity under his notice. He made it a rule never to reject any application unless he doubted its genuineness, and he often gave liberally without being personally asked for assistance. Mr Charleton took no very active part in politics, although his political convictions were very settled. His attention was mainly directed to social matters, and on the peace question, temperance, and kindred subjects he interested himself very deeply. He was a strong supporter of the temperance movement in the district, and of late years he took a great interest in the Contagious Diseases Acts, to which he was most strenuously opposed. It may be remembered that at the Social Science meeting held in Bristol three years ago Mr Charleton attended and strongly advised the repeal of the Acts. There have been few men in the neighbourhood of Bristol who have been so universally respected and beloved as Mr Charleton, and the announcement of his death will be received with heartfelt sorrow wherever the influence of his life has extended. Mr Charleton married some years ago Miss Fox, a lady from the neighbourhood of Bridgwater, and leaves one son, a boy of about twelve years of age. One of the great events in Mr Charleton's life was his visit, in company with two other Friends, to the Czar Nicholas - an interview which was at the time the cause of much discussion. The event is thus referred to in Chambers's History of the Russian War:-\r\n\r\n'Another effort to preserve peace, and one of a singular character, was made in a non-official quarter. The members of the Society of Friends have ever been remarkable for the consistency with which, through good report and evil report, they have deprecated war in all its forms; and they resolved on an attempt to move the mighty czar, who would not be moved by the united voice of Europe. On the 20th January, three Quakers - Henry Pease, of Darlington, Joseph Sturge, of Birmingham, and Robert Charleton, of Bristol - set out on a winter-journey from London to St. Petersburg, by way of Berlin, Konigsberg, and Riga. the route from Riga to St. Petersburg was traversed by means of sledges; and no fewer than three hundred horses were required for this service, by successive relays on the road. Considering the great amount of snow which had fallen, however, and the extent of the journey, the travellers reached their destination with less discomfort than they expected. On their arrival at the Russian capital, they obtained an introduction to a gentleman who had resided in Russia for forty years, and who, it was thought, would be of service to them in their delicate mission. He advised them to solicit an interview with Count Nesselrode, Chancellor or Prime Minister of the empire. This they did, stating that they had not deemed it advisable to apply to their own Ministers, or to the Russian ambassador in London; and that, for the same reasons, they had preferred applying to Count Nesselrode direct, for the purpose of securing his assistance in the presentation of the Society's address to the Emperor. They waited on the count, and left him a French copy of the address for the Emperor's perusal. As a consequence, they were admitted to an audience of the Emperor of the 10th. They read an address from the Society of Friends, praying the Emperor, in the name of that Christianity which was alike his religion and theirs, to avert the horrors of war by adopting some other means than those of bloodshed to heal the wounds between him and other sovereigns. He received them kindly, and then spoke at some length, throwing the whole blame of the war upon others - as was his wont whether in speaking or writing. He then introduced them to the Empress and the Grand Duchess Olga - daughter of the Czar, and Princess Royal of Wurtemberg - by whom they were courteously received. The Emperor sent a written reply by the three deputies to the Society of Friends in England; and thus ended an attempt, fruitless in result, but respectable for the singleness of purpose, an the unselfishness which had suggested it. The proceeding, however, did not pass without many strictures in Parliament. It was urged in many quarters that private individuals, however excellent their motives, could not thus assume the management of international disputes, without incurring a risk of embarrassing the Government on whom the responsibility of public affairs rested.'\r\n\r\nRecently Mr Charleton has not appeared much in public, but his letters to this journal showed that his mind was active and vigorous, and that the same class of subjects which had always interested him engaged his attention and receive his valuable support so long as physical strength permitted him to take a part in public affairs.",

About six months ago the deceased gentleman suffered from a severe chest complaint, which necessitated an absence from his duties from some time. Mr Warren, who was sixty-two years of age, was a native of Carmarthen, where some members of his family still reside. His father, a prominent member of the Wesleyan Methodist Connexion, for some years went abroad as a missionary, and returning to Carmarthen started in business as a druggist, occasionally officiating in the town as a local preacher. He then came to Bristol and opened premises in Redcliff Street as a wholesale druggist, and afterwards his three sons succeeded him, but of late years the sole control of the business has been under Mr Algernon Warren, who carried on the trade with great success, rarely a day passing that he did not visit the establishment. He, however, was too unwell to go there on Wednesday, notwithstanding a sense of duty made him, in pursuance of his week's engagement at the police court, attend on the bench. Besides superintending his own business, he took a deep interest in public affairs; and one distinguishing trait in his character was the ardour with which he entered into any movement he considered likely to prove advantageous to the city. As long ago as 1861 he evinced much interest in matters relating to the harbour, and advocated the proposed Clifton Extension Railway, that would have formed a junction with Canons' Marsh and the Port and Pier line - a scheme that was, after a great deal of discussion, abandoned. He took a prominent position in urging the formation of a trust for the docks of the city and those at the mouth of the Avon; and besides urging this measure upon the Town Council, spoke on it at different meetings held in Bristol. One of the leaders of the Liberal party in the city, he was an able supporter of movements for political reform, always giving effect to his views by well-delivered and thoughtful addresses. Twelve years ago he was one of the representatives of Redcliff Ward in the municipal council, and never failed to press upon the attention of the Corporation the consideration of objects that he thought would benefit the citizens. For some years he ceased to be a member of the Council, but afterwards was returned a member for the new ward of St. Philip's North, which he represented at the time of his death. He was on the Finance, Parliamentary Bills, and Library Committees, to all of which he rendered useful service. In 1869 Mr Warren presided at the dinner of the Anchor Society, the president for the previous year having been Mr Lewis Fry, the one of the succeeding year Mr Joseph D. Weston (the present Mayor); and in the year following the deceased's brother-in-law, Mr Charles Thomas was president. The formation of the Bristol Cambrian Society was due in a great measure to the exertions of Mr Warren, and he presided at one of its annual dinners. He was also chosen president of the Caledonian Society, and those who heard his speech in proposing success to that society recall even now the vigour with which he presented its claims and narrated striking events in Scottish history. His addresses at the Cambrian Society's banquets were always witty and forcible, and on last St. David's Day he attempted in an amusing manner to demonstrate that certain noted personages mst from their names have been of Welsh descent, somewhat after the manner that Dean Swift endeavoured to show that celebrated Greek and Roman heroes owed their names to modern English words rather than to direct classical derivations. Mr Warren was a director of the Channel Docks Company, and though not on the board of the Taff Vale Company, he was a large shareholder, and few meetings passed without his speaking at them. He also took an active part in the deliberations of the Chamber of Commerce. Mr Warren married a sister of the Messrs Christopher, Herbert, and Charles Thomas, proprietors of the Board Plain Soap Works, and that lady survives him. He leaves six children, four sons and two daughters, a third daughter having died within the last twelve months. His eldest son, Mr Thomas Herbert Warren, has gained for himself a brilliant reputation as a scholar, and is fellow of Magalene College, Oxford, and a member of the council of Clifton College. The second son, Mr Edward Warren, has lately been admitted a member of the Royal Society of Architects. The deceased was a Congregationalist, and attended worship at Highbury Chapel. To those who saw him a short time ago he seemed likely to spend many years of usefulness, as he spoke with his accustomed ability at the recent banquet of the Chamber of Commerce in proposing the toast of the 'Association of Chambers of Commerce of the United Kingdom', and a fortnight ago he gave a telling address at the annual meeting of the Liberal operatives' Association, held at the Star Coffee House. The intelligence of his sudden death will be read with pain and surprise by many, as his relatives did not anticipate a fatal result to his illness. Only on Saturday Mr Charles Thomas, his brother-in-law, and Mrs Thomas left their residence at Stoke Bishop for Southerndown, near Bridgend, where they intended remaining for some time. Yesterday morning they received a telegram informing them of the death of Mr Warren, and they returned home in consequence last night.",
07/01/1878,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Alfred Stone,"THE LATE MR ALFRED STONE\r\n\r\nThe announcement of the death of Mr Alfred Stone, choir master of the Bristol Musical Festival Society, has no doubt been read with mingled feelings of regret and sympathy by all the members of his choir, as well as by local musicians and the public generally. Mr Stone had attained a position of special prominence in musical circles, and a few words respecting his industrious career may not be out of place.\r\nAs a youth, Mr Stone entered the counting-house of Messrs Thomas, Fripp, and Thomas (now C. Thomas and Bros.), and the Broad Plain Soap Works. There his early musical talent, his steady industry, and genial manner, caused Mr E. B. Fripp to take great interest in him; and, following Mr Fripp's friendly advice, he wet to Mr Corfe (the late organist of Bristol Cathedral), for organ instruction. Under Mr Corfe's tuition his aptitude for acquiring musical knowledge speedily developed itself, and, with Mr Corfe's recommendation, he was soon enabled to obtain the position of organist in St. Paul's Church, Clifton, where for some time previously he had been in the choir. Eventually he left here to undertake a similar position at Arley Chapel, and subsequently, after some years' service, he became organist at Highbury Chapel. It was felt, indeed, that wherever congregational singing needed a strong impetus he would be successful; and this led to his return to his old post at St. Paul's, where the musical arrangement had undergone an alteration, and where the Reverend Canon Mather knew Mr Stone's musical knowledge and taste would be invaluable. Here he remained for some time, but finally left for Christ Church, Clifton, where, the duties being lighter, more time was left him for following the profession to which he was so ardently devoted. Besides these successive appointments, he had held for some years past the post of organist at the Mayor's Chapel, and among the many educational institutions which profited by his instruction in singing may be mentioned the Red Maids' School, the City School, and the Blind Asylum. Private schools and private pupils vied with each other for his tutorship. Mr Stone was a thorough musician; not content with the mechanical part of his profession, he entered into the higher aspects, and regarded music as the utterance, the expression in 'tone form' of the emotions, and his great desire was that his pupils should feel what they played or sung, endeavouring as much as possible to enter into the feelings of the composer. It was on this account his services were so eagerly sought after. Mr Stone aimed at perfectness of execution and design, and was not satisfied unless the music corresponded with the words. To him the organ was but a sustainer of the choir, and both of the congregation, and in his selection of tunes his object was to find music that should adequately express the sentiments of the hymn or psalm. No pedantic variation of time or volume had his approval, but any modulation the words demanded were considered obligatory. It may be truly said that many a congregation sings with greater feeling and reverence, because of the direct or indirect influence of Mr Stone.\r\nAbout 14 years ago Mr Stone mastered the tonic sol-fa system, and his classes were largely attended. When the first idea of a Bristol Musical Festival was mooted, and the question of a conductor came before the committee, Mr Stone was unanimously elected, and the grand success, musically, of the concerts hitherto given has amply justified the choice. Mr Charles Halle spoke in the highest terms of Mr Stone's talent, and said last November that there was no need for his band to rehearse with the choir, his previous experience of Mr Stone having convinced him that it was unnecessary.\r\nApart from Mr Stone's intensive love of his art, and his intimate knowledge of music and its accessories (he even studied the anatomy of the throat, going to a local professor for instruction in the matter), he had those winning ways without which no choir master can hope to say that a large majority of the Festival Choir worked with him because to do so was one of the pleasures of their lives.\r\nSome few years ago Mr Stone passed the matriculation examination at Oxford prior to taking a musical degree, but his duties in connection with the festival left him no time for the latter.\r\nMr Stone will be best known in after years for his editorship of the Bristol Tune Book - a book which, perhaps, more than any other (with the exception of the Hymns Ancient and Modern), has influenced, and will influence, the character of public worship both in England and in the Colonies. The editing of a tune book is no easy matter, yet in his short life and amid other engrossing engagements, he succeeded in giving two such to the public - the Bristol Tune Book, and the Supplement to the same. In these volumes are several tunes of Mr Stone's composing, and it will be found on reference how admirably he has caught the spirit of the words for which he wrote melodies. The Orpheus Glee Society has lost in him a most intelligent conductor.\r\nIn private life Mr Stone exhibited the most unselfish, generous principles, and the same warm heart that irresistibly drew men to him in his public relations. The loss of his widow and little ones is simply irreparable. He died at the early age of 38, at the residence of Mr A. N. Price, Stoke Bishop, whither he had been removed a few days ago in the hope that a change of air and scene might effect an improvement in his condition, which even then was alarming. his last appearance in public was at the two concerts given in November by the Festival Choir with Mr Halle's band, and the last piece which he himself conducted was Mr Roeckel's ode in memory of Titiens. He fell a victim to the colds long neglected, in devotion to his duty; he never would nurse himself or believe that he was ill, and would let nothing interfere with his public engagements till it was too late. He is to be buried in Arno's Vale Cemetery on Wednesday morning next, at twelve o'clock, when the Rev. Arnold Thomas will conduct the service.",
22/11/1878,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr R. W. Tibbits,"DEATH OF MR R. W. TIBBITS\r\n\r\nIt is with sincere regret that we announce this morning the death of Mr R. W. Tibbits, M.B., M.R.C.S., who expired at his residence, 1, Pembroke Road, yesterday morning, at comparatively early age of 38. About two months ago the deceased gentleman was seized with a paralytic stroke, and he continued ill fora considerable time. His health so far improved, however, as to induce the hope that he would recover, but on Tuesday he had a second seizure, of a very serious character, and he survived the shock for only about twenty-four hours. The announcement of Mr Tibbits' death will be read with very general sorrow, for both in his professional and private capacity he was deservedly esteemed amongst all with whom he was associated. He was a surgeon of special ability, as was partly shown by his appointment to more than one post of responsibility in the city.\r\nIt is well known that for a considerable period Mr Tibbits held the post of surgeon at the Royal Infirmary, and his relation to that institution was something more than a merely professional one. He took a deep interest in everything affecting its prosperity, and this was prominently shown during the discussion which arose as to the sanitary condition of the Infirmary. Since the death of Dr Bernard the deceased had acted as surgeon to the Bristol police force, and some twelve months ago, when Mr Crosby Leonard resigned his position of surgeon to the Bridewell, the appointment was given to Mr Tibbits. He also for some time represented the Faculty of the Medical School on the council of the Bristol University College, but resigned that post during the present year. For a number of years Mr Tibbits also acted as assistant surgeon to the First Gloucester  Volunteer Rifle Corps. Mr Tibbits leaves one child, his wife having died shortly after giving birth to this child about two years ago.\r\nIn Bristol and Clifton Mr Tibbits had many personal friends, and among these the comparatively early death of his wife and himself will continue for many years to come to be a source of heartfelt regret. Mr Tibbits took a deep interest in all questions affecting the public health, and we have had occasion to notice in occasional contributions made by him to our leading columns an earnest desire, expressed in convincing language, to make philanthropy do its work efficiently and with due  regard to the proper economy of means. Mr Tibbits was an able writer on subjects which engaged his attention, and nothing gave him so much pleasure as labour in which he believed he  was contributing to the happiness of others. By the Infirmary staff and his brethren in the profession his death will be regarded with the feeling which is evoked by the loss of a friend whose skill and kindliness of disposition command more than respect, and by all who have benefited by his skilled labours he will be lamented as one whose services were doubly valuable from the conscientious and faithful manner in which they were performed.",
21/12/1885,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Charles Felce Hare,"DEATH OF MR CHARLES FELCE HARE\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death, after but a comparatively short illness, of Mr Charles Felce Hare, at his residence, Beaufort Road, Clifton. Mr Hare had for some little time been under medical treatment, but his business life was interrupted only for brief intervals. Following an operation about a fortnight ago a chill was received in an incautious exposure to cold air, but it was not till Wednesday last the symptoms assumed a serious form, and the tidings of his decease, which occurred on Friday night, came quite unexpectedly to the wide circle in which he moved. Mr Hare had for many years been amongst those who took a prominent part in all that concerned the city's welfare. One of the most active members of the local Chamber of Commerce, he was chosen as president of that body, and was prevented filling the chair for a second year only by the pressure of other engagements. Mr Hare's greatest interest was manifested in the affairs of the Chamber of Commerce, and in a letter dated so recently as December 15 he wrote to Mr J. Colthurst Godwin, the president, saying that he would be unable to propose on the next day the resolution on gold and silver ratio for the meeting of the Association Cambers of Commerce standing in his name, as he was suffering from a most severe attack of cold, which, together with a slight accident to his leg, had quite prostrated him for a time. He was elected on the council of the Bristol Chamber in 1877, and form that time till a few days before his death had been one of the most regular attendants at all the meetings. He was elected president after passing the junior and senior vice-chairs, April 26th, 1882. At the annual meeting of the chamber in 1883 over which he presided, Mr Lewis Fry, M.P., said of him that the chamber had never selected a president who displayed greater zeal, assiduity, and intelligence in the conduct of the affairs committed to him. Mr Hare presided over the special meeting of the council of the chamber February 7th, 1883, when the promotion of the Bristol and London and South Western Junction Railway Bill was first discussed, and he gave evidence before the select committee of the House of Commons in favour of the bill. He also previously joined the deputation to the board of directors of the London and South Western Railway Company on the subject of that bill. On April 25th, 1883 he was re-elected president of the chamber, but was forced to resign that position on account of the pressure of other private and public engagements. He attended most of the annual and autumnal meetings of the Associated Chambers of Commerce held since his connection with the local chamber, and took part in nearly all the discussions affecting the general trade and commerce of the country. At the meeting of the Associated Chambers in London on the 24th of February, 1885, Mr Hare moved on behalf of the Bristol Chamber, 'That seeing the long continued depression in trade, the want of employment among the working classes, and the falling off to the export foreign trade, the Government be memorialised by the association to recommend her Majesty to appoint a Royal Commission in inquire into the causes'. In moving that resolution Mr Hare made one of his most effective speeches. Amongst the questions which he evinced a deep interest in were the Bankruptcy Law Amendment and the Sugar Bounty question, both by making speeches and writing letters to the newspapers. One of his latest communications on fair trade appeared in the columns of the Daily Press a few weeks ago. He had  represented Redcliff Ward in the Council since 1880, and both at the council meetings and at the committees on which he served he was known as one taking a thoughtful interest in most matters under discussion. In the dock question he had long had a special interest. By his courtesy and kindliness Mr Felce Hare made many friends, and his early death will be widely lamented. He was 34 years of age, was the son of the Rev. Henry Hare, grandson of Mr Charles Hare, and the great-grandson of Mr John Hare, the founder of the business of Messrs J. Hare and Co., Bath Bridge, of which Mr Felce Hare had been for a lengthened period partner. He was a nephew of Mr Sholto V. Hare, who on several occasions was Conservative candidate for Bristol. He was born at Bradford, Wilts; he married a daughter of Mr Bayfield Clark of Wingfield, near Trowbridge, and that lady survives him. The bell at Temple Church, of which Mr Hare was churchwarden, tolled a solemn peal on Saturday morning, and many residents of the neighbourhood showed their feelings of respect on becoming aware of his death.",
01/12/1879,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Rev S. A. Walker,"DEATH OF THE REV. S. A. WALKER\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death of the Rev. S. A. Walker, rector of St. Mary-le-Port, Bristol. Mr Walker had been ill for a few weeks only, but for some days past his condition had been critical, and he expired yesterday morning. Mr Walker, who was in his 71st year, was born in Dublin, and his father was a member of the Irish bar. He was a descendant of the celebrated Rev. G. Walker, whose active exertions in connection with that stirring incident in Irish history, 'the opening of the gates of Derry', has been so graphically described by Macauley. the deceased was educated at Trinity College, Dublin where he took the degree of M.A. In 1857 he was appointed vicar of St. Mary-le-Port, the living, which is worth about Â£800 per annum, being in the patronage of Mr George Cooke, of Clifton. Mr Walker, as a popular minister holding what are termed Evangelical views, was known throughout the country, and of late years his name was associated chiefly with the conference of Christians which met annually at Clifton. This organisation, though locally established by Mr Walker, could not be said to have originated with him, it being an adaptation of a conference convened by Mr Pennefather, of Barnet, who by a coincidence was also the son of an Irish barrister, afterwards a judge, taking his seat on the bench as Baron Pennefather. Besides attaining celebrity as a preacher, the deceased was a somewhat prolific writer. When a young man, and before becoming a clergyman, he published some books, and since then he had written many pamphlets, in addition to two large volumes on missions, issued in 1835. A few years ago he wrote anonymously a work which was much read, for private reasons preferring not to attach his name to the publications. The book in question was a tale entitled 'From the Curate to the Convent', and was announced as 'written by a Churchman'. For the last six years Mr Walker was a member of the Bristol School Board. He leaves a widow, but no children.\r\nBy the death of Mr Walker, Bristol has lost a citizen who, in his way, was a man of mark. On Church questions he thought strongly and spoke strongly; but even those who differed from him admired his conscientious fidelity to what he believed to be the mission of the Church. Mr Walker made many personal friends, and he will be missed not only by his congregation, who regarded him with a feeling akin to personal affection, but by the citizens generally, who knew him as a clergyman who thought no labour too great when he believed a good cause was to be advanced. The death of Mr Walker was briefly referred to in the morning at Mary-le-port Church by the Rev. J. Ormiston, of Dudley, who occupied he pulpit; and it was also mentioned in several other places of worship. The Rev. E. G. Gange, at Broadmead Chapel, in the course of prayer, blessed God for the life of usefulness that had just been closed; it was a life that, with Romanism in some parts of the Church, could ill be spared - a life of devotion to the truth.",
04/12/1879,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Thomas Kingdon,"DEATH OF MR KINGDON, Q.C.\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death of Mr Thos. Kingdon, Q.C., Recorder of Bristol. Mr Kingdon had been ill for some time past, and he expired on Tuesday at his residence, Clarendon Place, Kensington. The deceased was well known on the Western Circuit, and also as Recorder for this city. He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1848, became a Q.C. in 1866, and was appointed Recorder of Bristol in August, 1872, and presided here as Recorder at the October session following. Mr Kingdon made many friends, and was very highly esteemed for his excellent qualities, personal and judicial, and his death will be sincerely regretted by all who intimately knew him. Mr Kingdon's career at the bar was always looked upon in the profession with considerable expectations, and his appointment to a Recordership that had been held by so eminent a lawyer as Lord Chief Justice Cookburn met with general approval. In delivering his first charge to the grand jury here he modestly said that he would endeavour to bring to the discharge of his duties the best powers with which it had pleased God to bless him, and if the citizens believed that he faithfully endeavoured to do his duty he felt that they would give their confidence. The promise thus made was faithfully kept, and Mr Kingdon will be remembered in his official capacity as one who brought to the discharge of his important duties a keen perception of the value of evidence, and an ardent desire that in his hands justice in the merciful sense should be vindicated.\r\nAs a reminiscence of a period which is fast passing from the memory of the present generation, we may recall an incident in Mr Kingdon's career before he became a Q.C. About twenty years ago he was retained, with Mr (afterwards Sir) Frederick Slade in a somewhat famous breach of promise case, Miles v. Magan, which was on the cause list for trail at Bristol, Mr (now the Right Hon. Sir Robert) Collier being for the defendant, who represented Westmeath in Parliament. The case was settled, and was made the subject of a clever poem, written in the Irish patois, and 'said' to have been found on sweeping the court at the close of the assize. These verses originally appeared in the Western Daily Press, and were quoted very extensively. In this poem Mr Kingdon's name occurs:-\r\n\r\nSo the action was brought\r\nAnd the pleadings were wrought.\r\nBy 'cute Mister Kingdon, that rising young man;\r\nBound Counsellor Slade\r\nWas handsomely faad\r\nTo speak for Miss Ellen 'gainst Mister Magan.\r\n\r\nSince that day the 'rising young man' has done honourable public service, and he has passed away amid circumstances which remind us once more 'what shadows we are and what shadows we pursue'. \r\nOur London correspondent, telegraphing last night, says:- The great bell of the Temple has this week been solemnly tolling out its mark of respect to dead benchers. A day or two ago it was for Mr Roebuck, and now the knell peals forth for poor Tom Kingdon. Mr Kingdon, who has been for many years a Queen's Counsel and a bencher, will be deeply regretted on the Western Circuit, of which he was one of the leaders. His death also creates a vacancy in the recordership of Bristol. He belongs by birth to Exeter, and his wife, who died in 1876, was also the representative of a good West country family. Mr Kingdon has borne his burden of sorrow in the last four years, for not only his wife, but his oldest son, Esdaile Kingdon, a writer of no ordinary ability in London, had been taken from him suddenly. The deceased leaves a handsome fortune, I understand, to a daughter and two sons, one of the latter being a barrister in London, and the other an artist in Rome.",
16/10/1879,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Crosby Leonard,"THE LATE MR CROSBY LEONARD\r\n\r\nWe have already announced the death of Mr Crosby Leonard, the well-known surgeon, of this city, and the announcement will have been read with deep regret by all who knew Mr Leonard personally. Among his colleagues in the profession Mr Leonard was held in high esteem. His skill in the department to which he had specially devoted his attention and for which he had special qualifications, was fully recognised, and in saying that during the whole of his professional life he devoted himself to every individual case with the ardour of an enthusiast who believed that in contending with disease and in affording relief to those who have been accidentally injured, success depends to a great extent in bringing skill to bear at every stage at which abnormal symptoms manifest themselves, we are saying no more than is well known to the profession and to a large section of the public.\r\nNothing gave him more pleasure than to conquer in a difficult case, and many instances could be named in which his keen perception of probabilities, and his readiness at critical moments, have been the means of restoring patients to health which seemed to have gone for ever, and saving lives that had been despaired of by those who were closely watching the contest between the skill which Mr Leonard represented and the malady which was threatening life itself. Among his patients Mr Leonard's death will be lamented as a personal loss, while the members of the profession will regret the loss of a colleague whose manly character and splendid attainments gave him a well-deserved position.

12/09/1879,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Kirkman Daniel Hodgson,"DEATH OF MR K. D. HODGSON\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death of Mr K. D. Hodgson, who represented Bristol in Parliament from June, 1870, until December last. Mr Hodgson died at his country residence, Ashgrove, Sevenoaks. He never completely recovered from the serious illness which necessitated his retirement from Parliament, and it eventually resulted in his death, which took place at six o'clock last evening.\r\nMr Kirkman Daniel Hodgson, was the eldest son of the late Mr John Hodgson, of The Elms, Hampstead. He was born in 1814, and was educated at the Charterhouse. In 1843 he married Frances - who died in 1861 - daughter of the late Mr J. L. Butler, of Southgate. Mr Hodgson was a partner in the great mercantile firm of Baring, Brothers, and Co., of Bishopsgate Street, London. He was also a director of the Bank of England, of which he was for many years governor, a commissioner of the Public Works Loan Office, a justice of the peace for the Liberty of St. Albans and of Herts - of which county he was High Sheriff in 1848 - and  a director of the Pelican Life and of the Phoenix Fire Insurance Company.\r\nMr Hodgson, who described himself as a 'decided Liberal', sat for Bridport from 1857 to 1868. His connection with Bristol dated from 1870. On March 22nd and 23rd in that year there was a test ballot for the selection of a Liberal candidate, the result of which was as follows:-\r\n\r\nRobinson  ... 4,502\r\nHodgson  ... 2,861\r\nOdger      ... 1,335\r\n\r\nMr Hodgson was first returned for Bristol on the 25th of June, 1870, in a single context with Mr S.

The news of his retirement was received with regret by the constituents generally, and it was only when it was found that the nature of his illness precluded any hope of his being able to resume his parliamentary duties that the Liberal Party reluctantly accepted his resignation. By no one was this regret felt more keenly than by his colleague, Mr Samuel Morley. Speaking at the Colston Hall in November, when Mr Hodgson's retirement was imminent, Mr Morley, M.P., said he looked back with thankfulness on every ground, personal grounds especially, but on public grounds as well, to the time when he had been associated with Mr Hodgson in the representation of the city of Bristol. During that time they had never had an approach to a misunderstanding. Whoever might be his successor, he looked with deep regret at the prospect of losing the support of his old friend and colleague.\r\nDuring his connection with Bristol Mr Hodgson won the esteem of members of both political parties. Although he took no part in Parliamentary debates, his large commercial experience enabled him to promote the interests of the city, and his genial manner and felicitous speeches at public gatherings rendered him popular amongst all classes of the constituents. The news of his death will be received with regret in many circles, but by none will his decease be more sincerely deplored than by his former constituents at Bristol.",
18/08/1879,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Sir Richard Rawlinson Vyvyan,"DEATH OF A FORMER MEMBER FOR BRISTOL\r\n\r\nThe death is announced at his seat, near Helston, of Sir Richard Rawlinson Vyvyan, Bart., the representative of one of the oldest families in the county of Cornwall, and who had for many years occupied a prominent position as a politician of the old-fashioned Tory school in the days preceding the first Reform Bill. Sir Richard, who was born in 1800, represented Bristol from 1832 to 1837. He headed the poll in the former year, at the first election after the passing of the Reform Bill. His success was in great part due to a disagreement amongst the Liberals, who ran three candidates, Mr Baillie, who was elected, with about five hundred fewer votes than Sir Richard Vyvyan, and Messrs Protheroe and John Williams, the defeated candidates. At the next election, in 1835, Mr Philip J. Miles headed the poll, with 3,709 votes, Sir Richard Vyvyan coming second with 3,312. The unsuccessful candidates were Mr J. E. Baillie and Sir J. C. Hobhouse, Bart., both Liberals. This election was a surprise, as the show of hands at the nomination had been largely in favour of the Liberals. In 1837 Sir Richard Vyvyan declined re-election, and his connection with Bristol thus ceased. Four years later he was elected for the Cornish borough of Helston, which he represented until 1857.",
24/11/1871,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Henry Overton Wills,"THE LATE MR H.O. WILLS\r\n\r\nThe death of this old and respected citizen of Bristol took place yesterday morning, at his residence, Cotham. Mr Wills was in his usual health until a few weeks ago, when he had a very heavy attack of cold, which, we believe, eventually assumed the form of bronchitis, and terminated fatally yesterday. Mr Wills occupied for many years a leading position in the Liberal and Nonconformist circles of Bristol. He was a magistrate, and, for a considerable time, a member of the Town Council, having represented the ward of St. Paul until, finding his infirmity from deafness prevented him from discharging the duties as he desired to do, he retired from the Corporation. There were few more kind-hearted men. He was a generous giver towards all charitable and religious movements, and though a very staunch Dissenter, we believe he was not prevented by this fact from aiding in benevolent objects in which the members of other persuasions were prominently active. He laid the foundation stones of almost innumerable chapels, and in each case his contribution was large. It was only a few years ago that he made a tour in Wales with his friend Mr Morley, on which occasion, we believe, the Nonconformists of the Principality had reason to be pleased with the visit of two such wealthy friends. Mr Wills leaves a large family, having had ten or twelve children, some of them engaged in the large business with which he and his father and brother before him had been connected. Their tobacco manufactory in Redcliff Street is one of the most extensive in the country, and we believe one of the finest. It was said to be the practice of Mr Wills, when giving to public and charitable objects, to so regulate and increase his insurances, that his family should not be in any way sufferers from his munificence. Of the three brothers who were at one time actively occupied in business in Bristol, we believe only one now survives - Mr F. Wills, of Clevedon. The flags on the Council House and Exchange were half-masted yesterday, in respect to the memory of the deceased.",
28/09/1874,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Richard Poole King,"DEATH OF MR RICHARD POOLE KING\r\n\r\nThis gentleman, who has been seriously unwell only ten days, died at Brislington, where he has resided many years, on Saturday afternoon. It was his 75th birthday, and the sad event was not entirely unexpected by his friends, for his power of recovery was seen to be slight. Mr King was suffering from an attack of diarrhoea and inflammation, which from the first assumed a dangerous form, and when the bell of Redcliff Church tolled at the early hour of six yesterday morning the occasion for it was already imagined. During the day a flag at half-mast was suspended from the church, and in the evening the bell was again tolled. Mr King's career has been more influential than prominent, and his actions will be better remembered by his equals in age than by younger men. He had the art of governing others whilst himself remaining unseen to an unusual degree, and possessed the confidence of both political parties. Still he was a staunch Conservative, and there was no leader of his party more trusted and from whom advice was more often taken. It is no secret that he was repeatedly pressed to stand as a candidate for Bristol in the Conservative interest; and, it is believed, he would have thoroughly united the party. Soon after the passing of the Municipal Reform Act he served the office of Mayor; he was a member of, and had passed the chair of, the Merchant Venturers' Society; senior magistrate of Bristol, and chairman of the magistrates' board; the oldest member of the Town Council, where, sitting uninterruptedly for Redcliff, he occupied a somewhat analogous position to that taken by the late Mr Alderman Abbot. The death of these gentlemen within so short a period deprives the Conservatives of two most able leaders. Mr King's health had not permitted him to take much part in municipal affairs for some years, but his influence was exerted in many ways. Whenever he spoke his words were listened to with the utmost attention; in fact, he was regarded as the Nestor of the Corporation, and from his great experience in the affairs of the city he was frequently enabled to set matters right when they were historically wrong. The last two occasions on which we remember to have seen his name in print were the letter he wrote to the Times on the Ashantee war and his correspondence on Church matters with Colonel Savile, which recently appeared in our columns. He was, until about a year ago, when he retired, the chief partner in the African house bearing his name, and as a merchant his credit and integrity stood second to none. In Clifton society Mr King occupied an honoured place, and in the poorer districts of the city his abundant charities will be remembered and missed. Mr King was twice married. By his first wife he leaves a daughter, married to Mr Alderman Fox; and by his second - a sister of Canon Lyddon - there are several children.",
04/04/1874,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Alderman Henry Abbot,"DEATH OF ALDERMAN ABBOT\r\n\r\nWe deeply regret to have to record the death of Alderman Abbot, whose illness was announced in the Daily Press a few days ago. He had been ailing for some time, but it was thought that by change of air and scenery he would soon recover, and resume the important duties which devolved upon him. At first he went to Weston-super-Mare, but not regaining strength he resolved upon going to London to consult an eminent physician. He accordingly went to London on Sunday week, and was attended by one of the first physicians in the metropolis. It was then discovered that the illness from which he was suffering was disease of the heart. No grave results were then apprehended, and it was hoped that by judicious and careful treatment he might be restored to health; but in the course of a few days the symptoms gradually became worse, and such was his critical condition that his immediate relatives were summoned from Abbot's Leigh, where his family resided. He continued to get weaker until Thursday night, when he died. The deceased gentleman, who was about sixty years of age, married the daughter of the late Ald. Thos. Lucas, by whom he has several children. In addition to his being alderman of Bristol, he was chairman of the Bristol Water Works Company, director of the Ashton Vale Company, one of the Charity Trustees, and the head of the well-known firm of Abbot and Leonard,solicitors, of Albion Chambers. He served his articles with the late Mr G. F. Peters, after which he became junior member in the firm of Peters and Abbot. The partnership in this firm was subsequently dissolved, and then he practised alone. He afterwards entered into partnership with Mr Colston Lucas, and it was continued for several years, until in 1858 the firm of Abbot, Lucas, and Leonard was created. Upon the death of Mr Lucas, a few years afterwards, the business was carried on under the names of Abbot and Leonard, the latter of whom died on the 18th of January. Since that date, Mr Abbot, with the able assistance of Mr J. Warley, his confidential clerk, conducted the extensive business of the office. He will be succeeded in the business by his eldest son, Mr Henry Napier Abbot, in conjunction with Mr J. N. O. Pope - the firm taking the title of Abbot and Pope. The deceased, as a debater in the Town Council, had few, if any, equals. His speeches were able and argumentative, and always to the point. In his professional business he was a man of sterling integrity. He never advised his clients to fight their battles in the law courts unless there was absolute necessity for such advice. His desire invariably was to get grievances settled by compromise, and by this means, though for a time he might displease his clients, he promoted a conciliation which in the end turned out to be for the advantage of all concerned. In the death of Mr Abbot Bristol has lost one of its most worthy citizens, the profession which he adorned an able and honourable member, and society a kind and genial friend.",
05/03/1877,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Peter Freeland Aiken,"DEATH OF MR P. F. AIKEN\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death of Mr P. F. Aiken which took place somewhat suddenly on Saturday last, at his residence, Wallcroft House, Durdham Park. Mr Aiken was 78 years of age. For about forty years he was manager of the Bristol branch of Stuckey's Bank, and a director of the company. A few years ago he gave up the management, but retained his place as a director, although for some time past his health had been rather delicate. \r\nMr Aiken will be remembered in Bristol for his generous sympathy with local progressive movements. He represented Clifton Ward in the Town Council many years ago, and he was in 1846 one of the four vice-presidents of the Free Port Association, his colleagues being Mr Daniel Cave, Mr Geo. Henry Ames, and Mr Edward Thomas. Mr Aiken inherited a literary taste and was a man of culture, as may be gathered from his admirable address at the Centenary of Burns, held in Bristol on the 25th January, 1859, and also from his recently published work, 'Memorials of Robert Burns'. It was to Robert Aiken, the grandfather of the deceased, that Burns dedicated the 'Cotter's Saturday Night'; and to his father,Andrew Hunter Aiken, that Burns addressed his  famous 'Epistle to a Young Friend'. This 'young friend' married the eldest daughter of Mr Peter Freeland, merchant, of Liverpool - hence the name of the deceased, Peter Freeland Aiken. Mr P. F. Aiken, before he settled in Bristol, was an Advocate in Edinburgh. He married Constance Elizabeth Chetwood, only child of Captain Chetwood, and has left five children and seventeen grandchildren. In his day the deceased did useful work for this city, and the announcement of his death will be read with regret far outside the circle of his immediate personal friends.",
27/12/1880,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr James Flower Fussell,"DEATH OF MR JAMES FLOWER FUSSELL\r\n\r\nFew men in Bristol were better known, and not any more generally esteemed, than this excellent and generous gentleman whose death occurred, after a long illness, on Saturday morning at Abbot's Leigh. Dr. Fox was medical attendant of the deceased gentleman. Mr Fussell had for many years been the senior partner in an eminent legal firm formerly carried on by Messrs Savery and Clarke, then by Mr Clarke and Mr Fussell, and recently conducted under the name of Fussell, Prichard, Swann, and Henderson. His three partners were all connected with him by marriage, Mrs Fussell being a sister of Mr C. J. Prichard, and two junior partners having each married daughters of Mr Fussell. Not long since Mr Fussell lost his second son, Henry, to whom he was much attached, and the death affected him greatly. His eldest son, James, is a captain in the Bristol Rifle Corps, but resides chiefly in London, and another son, Thomas, who is usually at home, is not in any profession. Mr Fussell, in personal appearance, was the picture of amiability, and his worth agreed with his looks. He was one of the few men of sterling character who never makes enemies. By his family he was beloved with more than ordinary affection, and a large circle of friends will mourn his loss with more than common formality. Mr Fussell recently showed signs of age, and his figure gave the idea of more years than he had really attained. We believe he was in his sixty-fourth year, but till his last illness he was one of the first men at business in the morning and one of the last to leave. The firm to which he belonged were solicitors to the  Bristol and West of England Bank, the Water Works, the Cemetery Company, the Avonside Engine Company, and many other important corporations. When the Bristol and Exeter Railway was an independent company, Messrs Fussell and Co. were their legal advisors, and the head of the firm usually attended to their affairs in person. The Bristol and South Wales Union Railway Company was another company to which the firm were solicitors, and they assisted in its formation.",
26/10/1882,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Robert Carpenter,"DEATH OF MR ROBERT CARPENTER\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death of Mr Robert Carpenter, Town Councillor for the District Ward, which took place suddenly yesterday afternoon. The deceased had attended a meeting of the Watch Committee, of which he was a member, and afterwards kept an appointment he had made with a gentleman who wished to rent a house of him in New Jamaica Street. He went there and completed his arrangement with the tenant, and was about to leave the house, when he suddenly staggered and fell back into the gentleman's arms. A cab was procured, and he was conveyed to his residence, Rokeby House, Cheltenham Road, and Dr Taylor, the medical man who lived nearest, was immediately sent for. Almost as soon as Dr Taylor arrived Mr Carpenter expired. There is little doubt that death resulted from heart disease. Mr Carpenter, until the last month or two, had been remarkably healthy. He was chairman of the Colston Building Society, in Small Street, and did not attend the monthly meeting of directors for October; but at the September meeting he appeared slightly unwell, and remarked that the society would have to do without much aid from him during the winter, as he intended giving up some of his engagements. He was about 67 years of age, and had devoted himself for many years to business. When a young man he was employed as clerk at Harford's brass and copper works in Small Street, where the post office now stands. Afterwards he carried on trade in Broad Street as a cloth merchant, but he relinquished his business some years ago. He had taken an active share in municipal matters for the last fifteen years. An ardent Liberal in politics, he was treasurer of the District Ward Committee, who, on a vacancy occurring in the representation in the Town Council, nominated him to fill the post. He was opposed by Mr Henry Naish, whom he defeated after a severe contest, there being only a majority of a few votes. Since then Mr Carpenter has remained one of the representatives of that ward. Though he seldom spoke in the Council, he was a very useful member, and did good service on committees, being rarely absent, unless he was compelled to be away from Bristol. He was a member of the Finance, Streets Improvement, and Watch Committees. He was a director of the City Hotel Company, and guardian of the poor for the District in the Barton Regis Union. At one time he acted as commissioner for the district, but resigned this office a few years ago. He will be much missed at St. Andrew's Church, where he had been a constant attendant. He subscribed Â£5 towards the window to be placed as a memorial to the late Mr A. W. Pillers; and when the Rev. C. J. Clarke was vicar, and wished to make an addition to the schoolroom at a cost of Â£100, Mr Carpenter promptly collected the amount. The deceased had been twice married, his second wife, who survives him, being Miss Yeo, a member of a well-known North Devon family. He leaves four children, three sons and one daughter. One of his sons is a solicitor, and a few years ago entered into partnership with Mr William Benson, to whom he was articled.",

He was appointed to the incumbency of Portman Chapel, Baker Street, in 1847, and for nearly thirty years was well-known in connection with the Low Church party as an earnest and eloquent preacher. In 1872 he was made an honorary chaplain, and in 1873 a Chaplain-in-Ordinary to the Queen. In 1875 he was presented by Lord Cairns, the then Lord Chancellor, which he held up to his death. He resigned the incumbency of Portman Chapel in 1877, and has since then lived a more or less retired life. It may be mentioned that the Portman Chapel Voluntary Schools, which were founded and organised by Canon Reeve in one of the lowest parts of the district of which he took charge in Marylebone parish, continue to compete successfully with the School Board schools; and, as an instance, we may add that Mr R. Barker, whose education was commenced in the Portman Chapel Schools, is at this moment a foundation scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge. Canon Reeve was highly respected, and although, owing to his advanced age, he has not taken a prominent part in public affairs during recent years, he enjoyed in his retirement the esteem of a large circle of friends, who will hear of his death with unfeigned regret.",

13/11/1886,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Francis Fry,"FRANCIS FRY\r\n\r\nThe death of Mr Francis Fry removes from amongst us a citizen whose family name is a household word in Bristol, and who was himself personally as well known as he was highly esteemed. Mr Fry had reached the age of eighty-three. During his whole life he had been identified with the commercial and philanthropic interests of this city, and although for some time past his failing health had removed his familiar figure from our streets, his marked idiosyncrasy and his kindly manner will be long remembered. Mr Fry had more than a local reputation. His collection of ancient Bibles is said to be one of the most complete extant, and he did not resolve them as a hidden treasure, but at great expense he reproduced some of the most curious and valuable for the benefit of others who, like himself, felt a deep interest in the early editions of the Scriptures. His reproduction in fac-simile of the first New Testament printed in the English language was a very important undertaking, and a bona fide addition to the bibliographic resources of our time. The same may be said of his 'Description of the Great Bible, 1539, and the Six Editions of Cranmer's Bible'; and also of 'The Bible by Coverdale', which Mr Fry published about twenty years ago. The value of Mr Fry's work in this direction can hardly be estimated without a full knowledge of the difficulties which these and other kindred reproductions entailed. Mr Fry's extensive acquaintance with the interesting object which occupied so much of the leisure of his busy life was the result of a special enthusiasm which ultimately caused his name to be associated in all parts of the world with the Early English Bibles and Testaments. Mr Fry was one of the older citizens of Bristol, of whom so many have recently passed away, and he was consequently more closely connected with our local life some years ago than he had been recently passed away, and he was consequently more closely connected with our local life some years ago than he had been recently; but the announcement we make today will nevertheless be read with that sincere regret which is always felt whenever the death of a good man has to be recorded.",

The deceased gentleman resided at Frome Lodge, Stapleton, and on Wednesday he seemed in his usual health, and went to Lawford's Gate Court House for the purpose of transacting some business. He returned home and dined, and there was nothing unusual in his appearance till about eleven o'clock at night, when he was seized with an epileptic fit. Mr E. Crossman, of Hambrook, his medical attendant, was at once sent for, and he remained at Frome Lodge during the night. Major Castle did not recover power of speech, but he was able to recognise his wife and daughter. Yesterday morning Mr Crossman saw that there was no hope of the recovery of his patient, but Dr Shingleton Smith was called in for consultation in the afternoon. The deceased gentleman lingered till between four and five o'clock, when he expired. His sudden death caused much grief in Stapleton, where he had commanded general respect by the energetic manner in which he assisted in the management of local matters. He was always ready to give advice in cases of difficulty, and many persons consulted him with respect to their private affairs. A gentleman with whom he had been engaged at Lawford's Gate Court House on the previous day called yesterday afternoon to complete the business, and was greatly shocked to learn the sad event. Major Castle, who was about seventy years of age, was a younger brother of Mr Michael Castle, of Clifton, who went to Frome Lodge on hearing of the critical state of the deceased. Lady Bowring, widow of Sir John Bowring, is a sister. Major Castle leaves a wife and daughter. He was formerly in practice in Bristol as a solicitor. He had a commission in the militia, and during the Crimean War his regiment was called out for service at Pembroke. During the Indian Mutiny the regiment was again embodied, and he did service with it at Athlone. He was a consistent Liberal, and was for a long period rarely absent from the annual dinners of the Anchor Society where he used to respond on behalf of the auxiliary forces. He acted for some time as chairman of Stapleton Local Board, and was chairman of the directors of the Royal Hotel Company.

He served an apprenticeship in Bristol with Mr Nathaniel Lomas, printer, in Castle Street, and afterwards went to London, where he was employed on the Mark Lane Express and other journals. Though possessing little or no knowledge of the boot trade, he, in conjunction with his brother, Mr James Derham, forty years ago laid the foundation of the extensive business in St. James's Barton. Their beginning was at Wrington, and subsequently the headquarters were shifted to Bristol, where magnificent progress rewarded the perseverance of the brothers. Mr Samuel Derham, with his son, retired from the firm at the end of 1885. He took a deep personal interest in political meetings and questions affecting the city's welfare, but was of a retiring disposition, and rarely occupied a prominent place in public movements. For several years he had been one of the justices for Bristol, and was most regular in discharging the duties of this position. He had a fondness for scientific pursuits, particularly botany, and the last gathering he attended was a meeting of the directors of the Museum and Library in Queen's Road. That was on Thursday. On Friday morning while at breakfast he was seized with paralysis; he rallied and went into the garden, but the attack was repeated with added force, and he became unconscious. Death took place shortly after six o'clock yesterday morning. Mr Derham was highly esteemed wherever he was known. He leaves a widow and a married son. Before the business at the police court commenced yesterday, reference was made to the sad event. The magistrates present at the time were Mr Herbert Thomas, Mr Mark Whitwill, Mr W. Hathway, Mr J. A. Jones, and Mr J. Lysaght; and Mr Thomas, senior magistrate, said: We have just ascertained with great sorrow that our worthy colleague, Mr Samuel Derham, has been suddenly called away into eternity - that he died this morning soon after six o'clock. I am sure that all who, like myself, have had the privilege of sitting with him here valued the unusually good qualities which he possessed as a magistrate. In him were united the qualities of a good, sound judgment, strong common sense, and a good character and a good life, which are so essential to those who sit on the bench. I desire to express in a few words in this way the esteem which I felt for him, and which I am sure was shared by each one of his colleagues; and, like myself, I am sure they would like to express their sympathy with the deceased's widow and his son on such a distressing occasion to them. Mr T. Holmes Gore (magistrate's clerk) said he would forward this expression of sympathy to Mrs Derham. He need not say that he very much regretted the sad event, and that he valued the services which the deceased rendered there with so much satisfaction.",

Doherty, the present incumbent, was presented by the Simeon Trustees. Mr Clifford, who was M.A. of Cambridge University, was ordained deacon in 1831, and priest in the following year, by the Bishop of Winchester. He was curate at St. Stephen's, Bristol, with the late Rev. H. G. Eland. After his appointment to St. Matthew's he distinguished himself by the ability with which he entered into the discussion of controversial topics, and took a prominent part in some matters that greatly interested the religious world. He was an impressive preacher, and his discourse on prophecy attracted large congregations. He has left several children, one son the Rev. Alfred Clifford, being a member of the Barton Regis Board of Guardians. Yesterday the flag on St. Matthew's tower was at half mast, and the Rev. W. B.

The special duties of Mr Criddle's appointment made him exceptionally well known out of doors, and his great tact and good address won him many friends. Mr Criddle was wholly devoted to his work, and allowed himself little relaxation, but some years ago he held a commission in the Bristol Rifle Corps, and was known as one of the best shots in that battalion, which had produced so many excellent marksmen. Although his medical attendant had advised him to lessen his work Mr Criddle believed his strength much greater than it proved, and was at the bank as usual on Friday, dining at the St. Vincent's Rocks Hotel, where he was a permanent resident, the same evening.

Spark died on Sunday evening at his residence, 15, Apsley Road, Clifton, after a somewhat protracted illness. Mr Spark, who was 75 years of age, formerly took a practical interest in the trade and commerce of the city, but latterly, owing to failing health, he had been unable to take part, except to a very limited extent, in public affairs. He was many years ago in business in College Green as a silk mercer and draper. He came to Bristol some years ago from Exeter, and entered into partnership with Mr Bucknell, who was a mercer carrying on a flourishing trade in College Green, nearly opposite St. Augustine's Church. Afterwards the business was removed to premises near the Mayor's Chapel, where it was also conducted successfully. Mr Bucknell, besides being a mercer of repute, was noted for his skill as a florist, and at one time he resided on Alfred Hill. He left Bristol, but Mr Spark carried on the business in College Green for some time afterwards. He retired several years ago. As a representative of the ward of St. Augustine in the Town Council, Mr Spark took part in several important local movements. He was chairman of the Streets Improvement Committee, and his business capacity and aptitude were also of considerable service to the Sanitary Authority, of which he was at one time a prominent member. In appreciation of his invaluable services in promoting the welfare of the city, he was elected as an alderman, but in November, 1886, in consequence of indisposition, he resigned this position. He was also a magistrate for the city, and was interested in several local companies, having been chairman of the Bristol Gas Company and the College Green Hotel Company. Mr Spark, who, it will be remembered, was the father-in-law of the late Hugh Conway (Mr Frederick Fargus), was widely known and esteemed, and his death removes from local circles one who was remarkable for a genial and sympathetic disposition, courteous demeanour, and exceptional business capabilities.\r\nAt the Bristol police court yesterday morning, Mr George Wills said he would like to express the deep regret which he and his  brother magistrates felt at the loss of one of their colleagues, who had filled the office of magistrate for many years with great distinction. He alluded to Mr William Spark, who, unfortunately, succumbed on Sunday night after a long illness.\r\nThe funeral will take place on Thursday afternoon.

He had been in failing health for some time, but had not been confined to his house until within the last week or two. Few men in the county were better known. He was recognised as a leader of the Liberal party, and has taken an active part in political matters for the last thirty years, and was a trenchant and able speaker. He was also the founder of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Archaeological Society, and one of its chief members. Many years ago he succeeded the late Mr Barwick Baker as president of the Cotteswold Naturalists' Club, and this office he held until a few months ago, when he resigned with regret, stating that he felt no longer able to take part in the field work of the association. Sir William was a man of high attainments as a geologist, a naturalist, and an antiquarian. He spent a few of the earlier years of his life in the army, and when the volunteer force was formed, now nearly thirty years ago, he became captain of the Gloucester Dock Rifles, a company which under him attained such high efficiency that its challenge to any other company in England for a competition in drill remained unaccepted. He was also for some years colonel-commandant of the Royal South Gloucester Militia, a post which he resigned when the head-quarters were removed to Horfield.

Mr Edward Burges and the late Mr Henry Brice were, in 1840, appointed joint clerks to the committee entrusted by the Corporation with the carrying into operation the Bristol Improvement Act passed in that year, and, after the resignation of Mr Brice in 1853, Mr Burgess continued sole clerk until he himself resigned office in November, 1865. \r\nDuring the long period of 27 years in which Mr Burges was concerned for this committee a great number of very important city improvements were carried out. Mr Burges married the daughter of the late Mr William Perry, who survives him. He also leaves four daughters, namely, Mrs Salway, Miss D. J. Burgess, Mrs Lloyd, and Mrs O'Brien, and a son, Mr P. Burges. Mr Burges practised as a solicitor in Bristol for upwards of 53 years, and was on the roll of solicitors at the time of his death. His family have been, as is well known, intimately connected with this city for many generations. He was a large owner of property in the city of Bristol, and was well known as being one of the best judges of the value of property in Bristol and its neighbourhood. He was a man who was an ardent sportsman, and up to a comparatively recent period hunted regularly with the Beaufort and Berkeley hounds and was a member of the Berkeley Hunt. Many of our older sporting readers will remember him as one of the best riders to hounds that have been seen in this part of England. He was intensely fond of all sports and athletics, and was in his younger days a magnificent shot, good runner, oarsman, racquet player, and boxer, and in fact excelled in all athletic pursuits. In spite of his sporting propensities he was a man who conducted a very successful business as a solicitor. He has suffered for the last few years from heart disease and had to give up hunting. He was well aware of the serious nature of his complaint, and also that the end would be sudden. He had been unwell for the last few days, and only returned from shooting in Shrewsbury last week. He was busy all Saturday riding about his farm and property, and passed a good night. He was seized early  in the morning with an attack of angina pectoris, with fatal results.",

The deceased had for many years been in business upon the Welsh Back as a wharfinger and steampacket agent, and for a long time resided in Queen Charlotte Street with two sisters, he being unmarried. One of the ladies died about two months ago under distressing circumstances, and this affected him greatly. He attended service on Sunday night at St. Nicholas' Church, but feeling unwell left before the sermon was concluded. He had for some time suffered from an internal complaint, and this now assumed an aggravated form, so that on Tuesday night he expired, at the age of about 71 years. From the long time he had been a guardian Mr Thomas was known as 'the father' of the board, and on account of the great interest he took in the paupers he was made chairman of the committee which sat to revise the list of outdoor poor. If he was possessed a failing it was in lending too ready an ear to the plea of poverty, and his sympathies were easily aroused by a tale of distress. He was once appointed governor of the Incorporation of the Poor, and made himself familiar with the routine of the poor law. Outside St. Peter's Hospital his relations were, to a great extent, confined to the parish of St. Nicholas. He was a member of the vestry, and had been churchwarden. His politics were most pronounced; he described himself as an uncompromising Conservative, and it was therefore no matter for surprise that he became an energetic member of the committee of the Dolphin Society. Mr Thomas outlived two brothers, one of whom, older than himself, had been secretary to the Western Wagon Company, and the other some years ago died from the effects of injuries received at a fire on the Welsh Back, at which he rendered great service.",

Gale Coles, which occurred yesterday afternoon. Mr Coles had been ill at his residence, Cleve Wood, Downend, for several weeks, and on Thursday his condition was deemed so critical it was scarcely thought he would live through another day. Probably this fear led to the report which was circulated yesterday afternoon that his death had taken place, for his decease did not occur until a couple of hours later. Mr Coles was a little over seventy years of age, and was a man widely known in Bristol and the adjoining counties. He had a long connection with Stuckey's Banking Company, and as director he had for many years taken a prominent part in the management. He was High Sheriff of Bristol in 1867-8, being succeeded in that office by Mr W. H. Miles; Mr Francis Adams was Mayor at the time. Though not very frequently taking part in political gatherings, he was an influential Conservative, and was president of the Dolphin Society in 1876. He was a justice of the peace for Somersetshire and Gloucestershire, and was often in attendance at the courts at long Ashton, where he was chairman, and Lawford's Gate.

JONES\r\n\r\nWe regret to have to announce the death of Colonel Arthur Mowbray Jones, late commanding officer of the Bristol Rifle Volunteer Corps, which occurred very suddenly at his residence, Alexandra Road, Clifton, yesterday morning. The deceased officer, who was widely known and greatly respected in volunteer circles, held a commission for some five or six years in her Majesty's 75th and 27th Regiments of Foot, and served with the former for some little time in India. At the commencement of the Volunteer movement he joined the ranks of the Bristol Rifle Corps, then in course of formation, and was appointed Adjutant with the rank of Captain, being one of the first, if not the first adjutant gazetted to a volunteer regiment. After serving in that capacity for some years he was promoted to the rank of Major under Colonel Phillpotts Wright Taylor who was then the commanding officer. On the decease of Colonel Taylor, some nine or ten years ago Colonel Samuel Taylor, the senior major, was gazetted Colonel. Under his resignation of that position, after holding it for about two months, Colonel Jones was appointed commanding  officer, which honourable post he held until some eighteen months ago, when, to the regret of those with whom he had been associated for so many years, he tendered his resignation. The late Colonel Jones was possessed of a fine, commanding presence and soldierly bearing, and his sudden death is a most unexpected blow to his family and friends. His age was about 63. On Wednesday afternoon he was at the Zoological Gardens, Clifton, in the management of which he took a deep interest, until six o'clock, and on arriving home appeared to be in his usual health. About one o'clock in the morning he was attacked with an apoplectic seizure, and Dr Board, of Caledonia Place, was at once sent for. He however, did not rally, and death ensued between three and four o'clock this morning. In addition to his volunteer duties, Colonel Jones had for many years interested himself in the management of the Zoological Gardens of which company he was a director and hon. secretary. An enthusiastic botanist, and an accepted authority in botanical circles, it was in a great measure owing to his care and attention the Zoological Gardens were so well kept. It may be mentioned that at the recent visit of the British Association to Bath the arrangement of the exhibition of ferns was entrusted to Colonel Jones.\r\nDuring his lengthened connection with the Rifle Corps - upwards of 28 years - Colonel Jones gained the warm esteem and respect of the members. He had occupied an onerous position in relation to the corps not only as commandant, but also during his adjutancy and since he severed active connection with the volunteer force, he, in various ways, manifested a practical interest in its welfare. At the distribution of the prizes to the members of the Rifle Corps at the Drill Hall on December 3rd, 1887, Colonel Hill, M.P., referred to Colonel Jones's retirement, remarked that the city and the country owed that officer a deep debt of gratitude for the manner in which he had devoted himself to the service. 'Though his breast was not covered with medals,'\r\nColonel Hill remarked, 'Colonel Jones had done service none the less faithful and useful, and he doubted whether there was a soldier in the English army who could show a more useful record.' \r\nIn acknowledging the expressions of regret, Colonel Jones thanked the officers for the support which they had given him, and added some useful advice to the corps, and expressed solicitude for its future welfare.\r\nIn consequence of the death of Col. Jones, the officers' mess dinner, which was fixed for to-night, will not take place.",

AUSTIN\r\n\r\nWe deeply regret to announce the death of Mr Ebenezer Austin, one of the proprietors of the Clifton Chronicle, which took place suddenly yesterday morning, at his residence, Rodney Place, Clifton. Mr Austin had suffered from heart disease for some time past, and about twelve months ago, on the recommendation of his medical advisor, Dr Marshall, he gave up business for a time and went to Ilfracombe for the benefit of his health. The change effected a considerable improvement, and Mr Austin was able to continue to take an active part in the editorial work of his paper up to the last. He was in the city on Wednesday, and  was then appearing in his usual health, and he got up yesterday morning with the intention of again going down to Bristol, but while in the act of dressing he was taken ill, and before medical assistance could be obtained he had expired. The news of Mr Austin's death came quite as a surprise to his many friends in the city, in which he was widely known and  universally respected, and although he had attained the age of 65, but few judged him to be so old on account of his robust appearance and his energetic and systematic business habits. Mr Austin was born at Bath on the 3rd of October, 1818, and his father was connected with the editorial staff of the Bath Chronicle and the Bath and Cheltenham Gazette. He received his early education at a dame and adventure school at Bath, was subsequently a student at Mr Slatter's academy, and on leaving school he joined the Bath Mechanics' Institute, and became an ardent member of the elocution class. Left an orphan in 1830, he was apprenticed in the following year to Mr George Wood, the proprietor of the Bath and Cheltenham Gazette, and he joined the reporting staff of that paper on the 14th June, 1836. In 1848 he severed his connection with the Gazette, and took up his residence in Bristol, where he was appointed by Serjeant Stephen, the official shorthand writer to the Bristol District Court of Bankruptcy, of the proceedings of which he furnished reports to the Bristol papers. In 1855 he succeeded Mr W. Matthews as the correspondent of the Times, and this position he retained up to the time of his death.\r\nSubsequently Mr Austin became connected with the Clifton Chronicle, which was founded by Mr J. Burbidge in 1850, and he was associated with Mr C. T. Bleeck in the management of that paper until April, 1864, when the chronicle passed into his hands. In 1861 the deceased took a prominent part in the formation of the Bristol Histrionic Club, of which he was the first president, and there was seldom a performance at which he was not present and for which he did not write an original address. He dramatised 'The Pickwick Papers' for the club, and was a warm supporter of the movement initiated by the club for providing and supporting the Bristol and Clifton lifeboat, which is stationed at Lossiemouth, North Britain. Mr Austin was the author of 'Stray Leaves from the Note Books of a Provincial Reporter', which appeared in the Chronicle some years ago, and has since been reprinted in a small volume entitled 'Anecdotage'.\r\nOn the 20th October, 1881, Mr Austin completed his fifty years' connection with the press, and advantage was taken of the occasion to present him with an illuminated address, to 'mark the  appreciation of the energy and integrity by which he had been distinguished in his professional career, as well as his personal worth and kindly characteristics'. From his long connection with the press Mr Austin was widely known, and his death will be deeply lamented among a large circle of friends. His wife died about seven months ago, and he leaves a son - Mr Alfred Austin, who for the last few years has been associated with him as a partner in the business - three daughters, and an adopted niece.",

For a long time he acted as chairman of the Docks Committee, a position which he relinquished when he found the interests of the Channel Dock Company, of which he became chairman, clashed with his duties towards the citizens. The warm interest which he experienced in the port of Bristol led him to accept a post of responsibility in the Bristol Steam Navigation Company, though subsequently he ceased to take part in the control of the company. Gentle and unobtrusive in disposition, the deceased gentleman took a great interest in the church work of the diocese, and as a member of the Diocesan Conference he lent much assistance to Bishop Ellicott when head of the diocese of Gloucester and Bristol. He was especially zealous in all that concerned St. Peter's, Clifton Wood, of which he was made churchwarden when the original building was converted from a Wesleyan chapel into a church. In politics Mr Charles Nash was a Conservative. He married Miss Wilson, a Bristol lady, who resided at Queen's Parade, but has been dead  many years. Mr Nash leaves several children. His brother, Mr Joseph Haynes Nash is well-known in connection with some important commercial undertakings. the late Mr Nash, who was for a number of years one of the magistrates for the city, was also president of the Chamber of Commerce in 1874, succeeding in that office the late Sir Philip Miles, who had held the post of president of the local chamber for the long period of 15 years. He was a member of the directorate and chairman of the Western Counties and South Wales Telephone Company, and when that concern was acquired by the National Telephone Company, he became chairman of the local directorate. Warmly interested in all which affected the welfare of the citizens, he took a deep interest in the movement for the introduction of free libraries in Bristol, and he seconded the resolution, moved by the late Sir Joseph D. Weston, submitted to the ratepayers at the Colston Hall in May, 1874, in favour of the adoption of the Free Libraries Act. Mr Nash retired from the aldermanship in October, 1888. Of late years he has been closely identified with the parish of St. Bartholomew, in which he held the position of lay reader.\r\nThe funeral will take place at Arno's Vale on Saturday.",

Mr Sharland had taken a deep interest in labour questions, and although very few in the Council Chamber shared his views, his fellow members soon learned to appreciate the man and to listen with the greatest attention whenever he addressed them. Members of the Docks Committee particularly had opportunities of becoming acquainted with him, for he devoted much time to the work of that important department, and upon his withdrawal was the subject of an appreciatory reference by the chairman of the time, Ald.

Mr Sharland was not a robust man, and it was ill-health which compelled him to sever his connection with the Council, and to cease taking the part in labour movements that otherwise would have been his. In March, 1900, he was presented with an address signed by the president (Mr F. Sheppard) and secretary (Mr J. Curle), of the Bristol Trades' Council, and also by representatives of the Bristol Branch of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, and of Bristol Branch No. 2. This document was addressed 'To our comrade John Sharland', and contained the following acknowledgment: 'You have served the cause of labour well, and we unite in expressing our regret at the illness which compelled you to retire from the work you had at heart.

Hughes succeeded. With the growth of the undertaking the premises were extended to their present dimensions.\r\nMr Hughes was born in Bristol in 1833, and was educated locally. He was elected as councillor for St. Michael's Ward in 1890, and served for 15 years, during which time he was particularly interested in the docks. He was a member of the Docks Committee, and an advocate of a forward policy. He was also a member of the Electrical Committee from the commencement of the work until his retirement from the Council in November 1905. He was mover of committees for the new Municipal Buildings and the Municipal Art Gallery, and taking a great interest in the Cabot Memorial movement, he placed the tablet which appears on St. Augustine's Bridge, under the auspices of the local Antiquarian Society. He was a member of the committee which carried out the erection of the Cabot Memorial Tower on Brandon Hill, and the author of a monograph on the discovery. He was associated with several religious movements, including the Religious Tract Society. He was a director and chairman of the College Green Hotel Company for 30 years. He was registrar and surveyor to the Dean and Chapter of Bristol and Cathedral.\r\nThe deceased, though a Liberal was elected representative of St. Michael's Ward on independent grounds, and so thoroughly did he satisfy the requirements of the ratepayers that he held his seat without opposition. A staunch Nonconformist, he was associated with Pembroke Congregational Church, Clifton, of which place of worship he was senior deacon. He was also Sunday School superintendent. As an ardent member of the Peace Society, he represented the Bristol Young Men's Society, in 1850, at the Peace Congress held in Frankfort-on-the-Main, and when at Frankfort he passed in the street the Austrian General Hayman, then on his way to London, where he did not get the usual hospitable reception at the hands of everybody. The workmen of Messrs Barclay, Perkins, and Co., set upon him in consequence of his having flogged women in Hungary when putting down the revolution there. At the Continental Peace Congress held some months ago, Mr Hughes was again a delegate, and was the only member of the Congress present who had attended in 1850.\r\nA prominent feature of the deceased's business career was his connection with the Bristol and West of England and South Wales Permanent Building Society. His father, Mr Walter Hughes, was one of the first directors, and in conjunction with Mr John Lucas, Mr John Perry, Mr H. R. Fargus, Mr Thomas Danger, and a few others brought out the society. The first meeting was held at the office of Mr Danger, Bush Chambers, Corn Street, in May, 1850. Although not appointed a director till his father's death, in 1877, Mr W. W. Hughes assisted in the formation of the society. At one time father and son owned a cottage delightfully situated on the Wye, near Tintern, and there they spent much of their leisure time. After his father's death Mr W. W. Hughes retained his interest in the cottage for several years, though at length he disposed of it. He had been three times married, and his third wife predeceased him. He left five daughters (one of whom, Mrs Mackenzie, is on the Senate of the University of Wales) and three sons, two in partnership with him in College Green, and the other who took high honours at Cambridge University.",
04/11/1890,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr William Mack,"DEATH OF MR WILLIAM MACK\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death, at the age of 61 years, of Mr William Mack, at his residence, Chatley House, Limpley Stoke. The deceased gentleman who had for many years been connected with Bristol, where for some time he carried on business in Park Street as publisher and bookseller, was born at Clipstone, Northamptonshire, his father, who was minister of a Baptist congregation at that place, having been educated at the college belonging to the denomination in Stokes Croft, Bristol, and was a friend of the celebrated Rev. Robert Hall when the latter was pastor of Broadmead Chapel. The deceased was connected with journalism at Newcastle-on-Tyne, and after acting in the capacity of reporter he came to Bristol about 40 years ago, and started in business as a bookseller and stationer in Wine Street. Thence he removed to Park Street where he continued in business for about twenty-five years. He also had a publishing establishment in London. He was the originator and first publisher of the 'Birthday Scripture Text Book', which has had an enormous sale in a large number of editions. Upwards of a million copies have been sold including editions in the French and Italian languages. Mr Mack was formerly connected in Bristol with the Congregational Church at Castle Green. A number of the worshippers there banded together and, after meeting for services for some time in the old workhouse buildings, Pennywell Road, on the site of the present Vestry Hall, sufficient funds were raised, largely through Mr Mack's exertions, for the building of the chapel and schools in Stapleton Road. Mr Mack's connection with this place of worship continued up to the time of his death. As long as he was able he conducted the Women's Bible Class, and had not resigned the position of leader of the class at the time of his death. He was treasurer of the Bristol City Mission for a number of years, and had been a constant friend of that movement. He was also treasurer of The Friend-in-Need Society. He took an active part in carrying out improvements in the Baptist Chapel at Limpley Stoke, where the later years of his life were spent. Mr Mack gave largely to religious and benevolent objects in an unostentatious manner, and he will be much missed in Congregational circles. He had always been a hard worker, and the strain during the past few years had told on his health. In May last he went to America, and on his return, feeling strengthened by the change, he paid a visit to Scotland, where, however, his illness took a turn for the worse. He lay ill at Newcastle-on-Tyne for a considerable time, and had been at Limpley Stoke since the end of September. His strength gradually declined, and he died at half-past four o'clock yesterday morning. Both London and Bristol businesses will continue to be carried on by his sons. Mr Mack has left a widow to mourn his loss.",
02/10/1895,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr John Lysaght,"DEATH OF MR JOHN LYSAGHT\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the death of Mr John Lysaght, which occurred yesterday morning at his residence at Springfort, Stoke Bishop. The deceased gentleman had been in ill health for some time, the cause of trouble being an affection of the throat, in regard to which he consulted experts in Bristol and London, but in spite of all that medical skill could accomplish, the malady has had a fatal termination. Mr Lysaght, who was a member of a well-known Irish family, from Mallow, County Cork, came to Bristol about forty years ago and commenced in the galvanised iron business, which was then in its infancy. He at first took premises in Temple Back but, subsequently, owing to the extension of the business, the St. Vincent's Iron Works in St. Philip's Marsh were acquired, where the undertaking was still further consolidated and extended. In order to secure an adequate supply of sheets of iron for galvanising, Mr Lysaght purchased the Swan Garden works at Wolverhampton, and at a later period he also acquired the Osier Bed works, which are now the largest sheet rolling mills in the world.\r\n\r\nFollowing that enterprise, there was an extension of the Bristol works at Netham, where a new constructional department was opened, and spelter works were also established. The number of hands employed at Bristol was from 800 to 1,000, and there are probably more than that number engaged at the other concern mentioned. In 1881 the businesses were converted into a limited liability company under the title of 'John Lysaght, Limited', but the shares were not offered to the public. Mr Lysaght was a justice of the peace for the city of Bristol, and he served the office of High Sheriff in 1882-3, during which period he suffered a severe bereavement in the death of Mrs Lysaght. There are three sons and three daughters. The eldest son, Mr F. Percy Lysaght, is a director of the company, and another son, Mr Gerald S. Lysaght, is also associated with the business. One of the daughters is the wife of Mr George de Lisle Bush. The deceased, who was in his 64th year, had a second residence at Hengrave, Suffolk.\r\n\r\nSpeaking at Russell Town, Congregational Church last evening, Sir William Henry Wills, M.P., referred to the sad event. He said he could not allow the occasion to pass without a reference to a loss which that neighbourhood had sustained that day in the death of one intimately associated with the business pursuits of East Bristol for many years. He referred to the death of Mr John Lysaght. Mr Lysaght and himself never saw eye to eye in some things, but he had always had a great regard for him as an honourable and upright man of business. He commenced in a small way of business, and he extended his industries until they were very far reaching. He was an employer of a great number of men, not only in Bristol, but in other parts of the kingdom. He had been associated with Mr Lysaght in the direction of important works, and had always regarded him as a man in whom the fullest confidence could be placed, and whose word was as good as his bond. He was sorry they had been deprived of an influence so beneficial in point of trade and so high in point of moral integrity.",
15/02/1893,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Sir Charles Wathen,"SUDDEN DEATH OF SIR CHARLES WATHEN\r\n\r\nThe intelligence that Alderman Sir Charles Wathen had died suddenly in the Council Chamber yesterday afternoon created a sensation as painful in the breasts of citizens as did the announcement of the sudden death of Mr James Ford at the Constitutional Club a few years ago, and the  recent news that Judge Metcalfe had expired at the Guildhall while preparing to go to the bench. For some time past Sir Charles had complained of being unwell, and stated that he had pains in the region of the heart. There was a quarterly meeting of the Municipal Council yesterday, and just before noon, when the proceedings commenced, he was observed by Mr Cleverdon leaning against Lloyd's Bank in Corn Street. Mr Cleverdon accosted him, and jocularly asked if he was surveying anything. Sir Charles replied in the negative, and, pressing his left side, remarked that he felt severe pain. Before entering the Council House he told Mr Charles Wills that he did not feel very well. He took his seat in the Council Chamber, and sat on the front padded bench near where Alderman Low usually  sits, that gentleman being absent through illness. Nothing unusual occurred during four hours, there being a long agenda, no fewer than twenty-two notices appearing upon the paper. As four o'clock approached Mr H. N. Abbot proposed that an adjournment should take place, and the remainder of the business remain over to a day to be fixed. This resolution was seconded, and was about to be put to the meeting by the Town Clerk, when Sir Charles Wathen rose and urged that before the Council separated a motion of which he had given notice might be considered; it was next in order and was of a pressing character. The subject was a proposal to permit space between the old Drawbridge and the Stone Bridge, now covered, to be the site of an industrial exhibition on a large scale similar to one held at the Drill Hall about eight years ago. Sir Charles Wathen felt considerable interest in this project, and so impressed many members of the Council with its importance that, upon the house dividing whether there should be an adjournment forthwith or that the subject should be debated, a majority expressed themselves in favour of discussing the proposition at once. There was a strong opposition on the part of some of the members of the Council to the space in question being utilised in the manner advocated by Sir Charles Wathen, and a meeting of the Fixed Bridge Committee was held on Monday to object to the scheme. The resolution was moved by Sir Charles in a straightforward speech, and he referred to points which should make the proposal favourably received. Alderman Dix, who was a prominent champion of the fixed bridge, spoke against the spot being used for an exhibition; and after him Mr W. Howell Davies spoke.\r\nIt being four o'clock no disposition was apparent to prolong the debate, but Mr George White, who had expressed himself adverse to the proposed site and favourable to the large open space in Baldwin Street being that where the exhibition should be held, was expected to address the house, and he rose and spoke. He had called in question the accuracy of some figures as to the sizes of the respective sites in Baldwin Street and the Drill Hall with adjoining premises where the last great show of the kind was located. Sir Charles now and then interposed, insisting upon the correctness of the measurements he had given, but nothing unusual was noticed till just before half-past four, when he fell from his seat. Mr Charles Wills was sitting near, and he at once rushed to his assistance, and Alderman Fox and Sir George Edwards, who were sitting on a side bench, also  assisted, and they laid Sir Charles upon the floor. In an instant the chamber presented a scene of confusion. Members got up hurriedly from their seats, and with the Town Clerk, the treasurer, and the assistant clerk (Mr Sampson) strove to learn the nature of the seizure. Dr Cunningham, one of the councillors, was present, and he at once did all that medical skill could suggest, and some brandy and water having been obtained, a small quantity of the liquid was administered. Sir Charles breathed heavily, but seemed quite unconscious. Meanwhile another medical gentleman was sent for, and Dr. R. H. Baxter, of Barrow Lane, Barton Hill, arrived. It was however apparent that Sir Charles was beyond aid. The Mayor (Mr W. R. Barker) announced the meeting at an end, and with Alderman Fox drove to Ashley Down to break the intelligence of the seizure to Lady Wathen. Soon after their departure the two doctors announced life extinct. The body remained upon the carpet near a table at which the civic officials sit, and the members of the Council, having taken a last look at the remains, slowly retired. The sad intelligence of the tragic termination of the sitting soon spread through the centre of the city, and Mr F. W. Lewis, nephew of Sir Charles, who is a partner at the establishment in Broad Street, was fetched. Mr E. W. Coathupe, the chief constable (who is also a skilled medical practitioner), and Dr Pickering, of Berkeley Square, also arrived. The Mayor and Alderman Fox found Lady Wathen at home, and in half an hour they had returned with her to the Council House. She arrived ignorant of her husband's death, and before anyone could intervene had rushed up the staircase and gained access to the room where she beheld his lifeless remains. A most distressing scene was witnessed, and Lady Wathen stayed in the chamber for about ten minutes, when she was assisted downstairs in an almost prostrate condition. In addition to Mr F. W. Lewis, Mr R. Hill, and Mr W. Hill, partners in the firm of Wathen, Gardiner, and Company, visited the Council House, in company with Mr H. G. Doggett, Sir Charles's legal adviser. The body was removed to Ashley House, Ashley Down. Sir Charles was to have given a dinner there last night, having invited the officers from Horfield Barracks.\r\nThe deceased, who was 61 years of age, was connected with the wholesale and export clothing trade, and had for an ancestor Sir Samuel Wathen, of Stroud, whose son was Sir Paul Bagot, he having assumed that name. A large mill near Stroud was called 'Paul Wathen's mill', and the deceased's father, one of the firm who owned it, subsequently came to Bristol, as the firm was dissolved. Mr Charles Wathen went into business in the cloth trade and subsequently removed to Castle Street, where he became acquainted with Mr Henry Gardiner, wholesale clothier, of Broad Street. They entered into business relations, and, as Mr Henry Gardiner had decided to leave a commercial pursuit, it was decided that Mr Wathen should join Mr Charles Gardiner in partnership. The union continued for many years, and the reputation of the firm of Wathen, Gardiner, and Co. became extensive. Mr Wathen, who had married Miss Chase, paid a visit to Australia, and while there succeeded in transacting considerable business for the Bristol house. From the year 1872 to the year 1887 he was the head of the business which is at present carried on by Mr Robert Hill, Mr F. W. Lewis, and Mr W. Hill. After the deceased left the firm he continued to make the office his head-quarters. He was twice married, being after the death of his first wife wedded to Miss Sexton, of Ashburton. He had three adopted daughters, one of whom is married to Mr Kossuth Robinson.\r\nMr Wathen became a member of the Town Council in 1877, when he was elected for St. Paul's Ward in succession to Mr Thomas Wedmore. He continued to represent the constituency until November, 1889, when he was elevated to the aldermanic bench in the place of Mr Charles Nash, who resigned. In 1884 he was elected Mayor in succession to Sir Joseph D. Weston, and he filled the office in a manner that sustained the dignity of the civic chair. He was again elected to be chief magistrate in the following year, 1885-1886. Sir George Edwards was asked to allow himself to be nominated in the succeeding year; but subsequently Alderman Wathen was chosen, and altogether he was Mayor of Bristol six times, to the gratification of his fellow citizens. He took an active part in the work of important Council committees, and at the time of his death was chairman of the Streets Improvement Committee, the Floods Committee, and the Committee of Visitors to the Lunatic Asylum. He was also vice-chairman of the Finance Committee. In politics he was a Liberal till 1886, when he became a Unionist.\r\nOutside the Town Council, where he always had considerable influence, especially in matters of fiance, the deceased took an active part in many movements affecting the welfare of the city. The Triennial Musical Festival, which another Mayor, Sir George Edwards, supported with public spirit, found in Mr Wathen a no less earnest friend, who not only interested himself in its success, but with the Mayoress received the large choir at the Mansion House. When the autumn session of the Baptist Union was held in Bristol he gave a reception to the President, the delegates, and their friends, and leading citizens at the Colston Hall; about 3,000 persons were invited. It was a well-known fact that he showed great liberality in connection with the Baptist Missions and one of the African stations on the Congo bears his name. When the United Presbyterian Church was formed in Bristol he became one of its strongest supporters and remained attached to it during the pastorate of the late Rev. Matthew Dickie. Afterwards he became connected with the Baptist denomination, though subsequent to becoming Mayor he felt a great regard for the Church of England, and for some years was a regular attendant at St. Mark's, College Green. He was a liberal contributor to the Cathedral Restoration and Bristol Bishopic Fund; and the thoroughness with which the restoration of the Mayor's Chapel was carried out a year or two ago was owing in a large measure to his generous support. When the Bath and West of England Society came to Bristol the council and friends found generous treatment from him, and the Indian and Colonial visitors, after a banquet in their honour at the Mansion House, and the ball which followed at  the Victoria Rooms, were so impressed with the magnificent hospitality of the ancient city that they marked in a special manner their sense of this reception and sent a handsome gift, which Mr Wathen presented to the city, to be retained at the Mansion House. The important part he took in connection with the erection of the Queen's statue in College Green, and the reception and entertainment of Prince Albert Victor on the occasion of his visit to unveil the statue are not likely to be soon forgotten. On the 1st of January, 1890, the Marquis of Salisbury forwarded a letter to Mr Wathen stating that he was authorised to inform him that the Queen was pleased to confer upon him the honour of Knighthood, in recognition of the services which he had rendered to the city of Bristol during his mayoralty. One of the latest public acts of Sir Charles was to announce his intention of assisting in the Museum and Library in Queen's Road being handed over free of debt to the city, which meant a gift by himself of about Â£3,000. A short time ago he purchased Cook's Folly, and planned extensive alterations in order to adapt it for his residence. He had of late given up many engagements of a public character; and only two days ago, in reply to a communication from the Rev. A. N. Blatchford, who is president of the Cambrain Society, he wrote a courteous letter announcing that he had given up attending public dinners. Mr Doggett, the coroner, was made acquainted with the sudden death of Sir Charles Wathen, but he stated that there was no necessity for an inquest, as the medical evidence showed death to be attributable to syncope.",
07/11/1895,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Rev. Caldicott,"DEATH OF MR CALDICOTT\r\n\r\nWe regret to have to record the death, at the age of 66, of the Rev. Dr. Caldicott, whose sudden indisposition on Sunday was followed by symptoms of a very serious nature. He was for some time unconscious, and early yesterday morning expired. It is now twelve years since Dr Caldicott left Bristol, and the younger generation have little knowledge of the prominence he occupied in a variety of departments of civic life. He was a Birmingham man, educated at King Edward's Grammar School in that town, and continuing his studies at Jesus College, Oxford University, where he took his degree with honours. The story of his appointment to the Bristol Grammar School is well and briefly told by Mr John Latimer, from whose Annuals of Bristol we quote it.\r\n\r\n'During the spring of 1859 the local Charity Trustees entered into correspondence with the Charity Commissioners in reference to certain proposed alternations in the scheme under which the Grammar School was governed. Although the success of the school since its re-organisation exceeded all hopes, yet, through the slenderness of the endowment, the head-master and teaching staff had been inadequately remunerated for their labours. It was consequently  suggested that the fees paid by the elder class of boys should be slightly raised, that admission should not be restricted to youths residing in the city and suburbs, and that the head and second masters should be allowed to take boarders. The last mentioned proposal was strongly condemned by a minority of the trustees; and, though approved by the Charity Commissioners, the Master of the Rolls, on an appeal for his interference, refused to give it his sanction. Mr C. T. Hudson, the head-master, in consequence, resigned his post in May, 1860. He was succeeded by the Rev. J. W. Caldicott, M.A., tutor and mathematical lecturer at Oxford University, under whom the school attained an unexampled reputation, the successes of its pupils in competitive examinations being in some years proportionally greater than in any other public school. Dr Caldicott resigned his post in 1883, on being appointed to the valuable college living of Shipston, Worcester. He was succeeded by Mr R. Leighton M.A., who had taken high classical honours at Oxford.' \r\nWhen Dr Caldicott became master of the Grammar School it was of course carried on in the old buildings at the corner of Unity Street and Denmark Street, the site now occupied by that fine home of technical instruction - The Merchant Venturers' College. There were at that time 170 boys in the school, and the staff consisted of nine masters. Under Dr Caldicott's superintendence the school grew in reputation, importance, and in usefulness. Its transference to its splendid new headquarters in Tyndall's Park occurred in 1879 and by that time the students had increased exactly a hundred and the staff had grown to 14 masters. The move was one of the important epochs in the history of the old institution, and the scheme was the outcome of an immense deal of thought and care on the part of the governors and the head-master. The opening day was Saturday, May 17th, 1879, and it was made memorable by the presence and speech of one who was mainly instrumental in changing the whole aspect of elementary education in this country - the Right Hon. W. E. Forster. To an audience which crowded the great hall he spoke long on his favourite topic, education, and having stated that he had been making inquiries about the school he congratulated the fathers and mothers of Bristol on its possession. Its excellence was proved, he reminded them, by the honours and results which had been attained in competition at the Universities and elsewhere, and, added the Right Hon. gentleman, 'I need not remind you mainly that we owe that to Dr Caldicott and his staff'. There were other references similar in tone at that great gathering. The chairman of the governors, Mr Herbert Thomas, alluded to the origin of the institution, to some features of its history, and then followed a declaration which deserves reproducing. 'At no time since 1532 had they possessed a head-master more worthy to guide and train the youths of the city than they now possessed in the Rev. Dr. Caldicott'. Dr Caldicott had occasion to remember the meeting, for on behalf of many of the old boys was presented to him a beautiful silver centre piece, with an illuminated address, worded as follows :- \r\n'On the inauguration of the new buildings of the old Grammar School, we, the former pupils of the school, beg you to accept the accompanying gift as a heartfelt acknowledgment of the debt of gratitude we owe to you, not only of much kindness shows to many of us personally, but for the great and lasting service you have rendered us all as citizens in maintaining and extending the usefulness of the school, and securing for it - we hope for all time - that place amongst the public schools of the country which is due both to the school itself and to the ancient city of Bristol. We feel that to you chiefly the city owes this new era upon which the school is now entering, and in the continuance of your head-mastership for may years to come she will find the best possible security that the school will continue to be an honour to herself and a faithful Alma Matar to her citizens. In this work we pray that every blessing may attend you, and that you may find in your future pupils a respect as true and an affectionate sympathy as deep as is felt in the hearts of the former pupils of the school.'\r\nThe removal of the school to the high level did not check the satisfactory progress, but rather tended to augment it, and when Dr Caldicott gave up his post to leave a busy town for the quiet of a country rectory, he had the satisfaction of seeing a school in the heyday of prosperity with 328 scholars and 17 masters. The quality of the teaching was admittedly high. In the nine years 1855 to 1863 inclusive, the school gained 18 distinctions in Oxford and Cambridge, and it was reported on Speech Day 1883 -the last that Dr Caldicott attended before his departure - that for the last ten years (1873 to 1883) there had been gained on average as many such honours every year as they gained in the whole of that period of nine years to which reference had been made. Even still more remarkable as a testimony to the solidity of the mental building done under Dr Caldicott's regime was another fact mentioned at the same gathering, viz., that at Oxford old scholars were on the teaching body in four out of twenty-one colleagues; that one was similarly engaged in one of the most important colleges at Cambridge, and one was professor of mathematics in the University College of London. In discussing his merits as a schoolmaster with those who knew him best, there is only one matter in which criticism is ever heard - Dr Caldicott in some cases scarcely realised that everybody had not the same splendid physique and mental capacity for hard work with which nature had endowed him.\r\nNot only was he an ardent educationalist but a remarkably keen politician also. His convictions were not of the milk-and-water sort, and his outspoken views were heard at meetings of the old Liberal Association which came to an end when Bristol was parted into four divisions for the purposes of parliamentary representation; and at public gatherings his tall figure was familiar at many an Anchor board on Colston Day, and on such occasions he generally had a share in the toast list. When Mr W.E. Forster's Education Act came into force, and Bristol was called upon to create a School Board, he became one of its members, and with Mr Justice Norris, then practising in the Western Circuit, he was an uncompromising foe to anything that appeared to savour religious inequality. Those were the days when the religious difficulty was bugbear in regard to board school education. There had not been the experience showing the working of the simple Scriptural instruction such as that given in the Bristol board of schools with such satisfactory results, and both Dr Caldicott and Mr Norris were whole-hearted members of the Birmingham League, which went in for purely secular teaching in board schools. It was a position not many clergymen have occupied, but Dr Caldicott was by no means an ordinary man, and unorthodoxy had no terrors for him. His Liberalism survived the trial which removed so many from the ranks of the party, and as recently as the last general election he was taking part in a Liberal gathering in Worcestershire.\r\nWhen Dr Caldicott's connections with Bristol was ceasing there were many references to his valuable work.  One of these was by Mr Samuel Morley, then M.P. for the city. In the course of a long address delivered at the Grammar School in August, 1883, he said - 'Speaking for himself he could most truthfully say that among many precious memories connected with the city of Bristol, there were none that would be more thoroughly gratifying to himself or the subject of more precious recollections, than the friendship which he was thankful to say had been formed between Dr Caldicott and himself. He had many a time been thankful for the clearness, the straightforwardness, the independence, and the great intelligence which, as he thought, had distinguished his friend, and he thankfully and publicly recognised in his presence the obligations under which he had [UNCLEAR] and that in the seclusion of retirement to which he was about to resort, he might have those enjoyments which must result from the consciousness of having most nobly done his duty.' Sentiments like these found no lack of endorsement, and Dr Caldicott was not allowed to go without tangible expressions of the esteem in which he was held. At the meeting at which Mr Morley delivered the address quoted from, the head boy, H. L. Smith, desired to acknowledge the great service of the retiring head-master and explained that a sum of Â£250 had been contributed to form a presentation fund. The form of the testimonial was in itself an evidence of Dr Caldicott's zeal as an educationalist and of his love for his old school, for by his desire the amount subscribed was used as an endowment fund for the school library. Dr Caldicott's own speech was full of good feeling, and of cordial recognition of the help he had received in the school from Mr Openshaw, the second master, and from the governing body, who 'full, perfect, and frank confidence' he especially acknowledged. The words with which he concluded were indicative of the manner of the man, and are noteworthy in days when denominationalism has become recrudescent. 'He would venture to express a hope that neither governors nor masters would consent to any change in the fundamental principles on which the school was governed. Mr Morley had spoken with just criticism of the attempts lately made to construct public schools which should be specially connected with the Church of England. He should have been glad to have heard Mr Morley extend his criticism - he did not imply he did not do so - to all schools which set up a narrow and confined basis of operations. He did not believe in the moral effect of schools confined to this or that class in social condition any more than he believed in the good moral effect of schools confined to this or that section of religious belief. England was what she was not because they had rich people on one side, and poor people on the other, not because they had well-born people on one side and vulgar people on the other, not because they had people of one religious belief on one side and people of another religious belief or without any religion at all on the other, but England was great because, whatever might be the distinction of class, of religion, or of political principles, all stood together in time of danger as one man. It was the unity of feeling in Englishmen that compensated for the lack of her population and for the smallness of their home territories. It was that unity of feeling which great schools like that were intended to maintain. Let them not take their rich boys, or their well-born boys, or their Church of England boys and train them together to think themselves the salt of the whole earth and to treat others as vulgar outcasts from their ranks. On the other hand, let them not select the poor children or the so-called ill-born children, and allow them to learn lessons of narrowness from the example set on the other side. Rather let it be the endeavour to teach English boys to mix together and be united, and depend upon it, if they succeeded in inspiring them as boys in the spirit of unity, they would hereafter find them prepared to stand shoulder to shoulder against world.'\r\nOn August 1st, good-bye was said to Dr Caldicott at a dinner at the Clifton Down Hotel, which was attended by a crowd of leading people in this part of the world. Mr H. Thomas, Chairman of the Governors, presided, and he joined in the  hearty recognition of the good work Dr Caldicott had done. After his health had been drunk the rev. gentleman was presented with a service of plate of the value of about 150 guineas. This led to more kindly speech-making, and Mr Lewis Fry added his testimony to that of Mr W. H. Wills, not then knighted, and other speakers. At a later date Dr Caldicott came back to Bristol and met many of his old students at dinner at the Montague. Although far removed from the scene of the labours of the best part of his life, he continued to feel an interest in the institution that had been his pride,and in July last he was present at the dinner of old boys held in London, and in responding to the toast of 'The Old School' he said as a former head-master of Bristol Grammar School he felt proud of the success in life which had been achieved by his former pupils, and the honour which they had thereby conferred on a great educational institution.\r\nDr Caldicott was also rural dean of South Kineton. He was Select Preacher at Oxford 1889 to 1891, was J.P. for Warwickshire and Worcestershire, an alderman of the Worcestershire County Council, and chairman of the Charities Committee of the Council. He leaves a widow and two sons.",
08/02/1892,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Dr G. F. Burder,"DEATH OF DR BURDER\r\n\r\nThe announcement of the death of Dr G. F. Burder, of Clifton, will be received with widespread regret. The deceased had practised in Clifton during the whole of his career, and he took the warmest interest in the Bristol General Hospital and the Bristol Medical School. He was connected with the Hospital for nearly thirty years, and was senior physician for a considerable period, while his services as lecturer at the Medical School were very highly appreciated by the faculty. Beyond the medical profession Dr Burder was widely known as a clever meteorologist. He occasionally lectured on the subject, and was a frequent contributor to the Daily Press on meteorological subjects. The deceased had been in failing health for some time, and had been obliged to relinquish a portion of his practice in consequence. He frequently complained of pains in the chest after much exertion, and it was feared that that arose from an affection of the heart. On Saturday evening Dr Burder attended a dinner and scientific meeting at the Queen's Hotel, and afterwards walked to his residence, 7, South Parade, Clifton, arriving there shortly after ten o'clock. He appeared much distressed, and his nephew, Mr E. J. Burder, expressed regret that he had not ridden, the doctor's reply being that it scarcely seemed worth while to ride so short a distance. These were the last words he uttered, as almost immediately afterwards the doctor sank into a chair and expired. The deceased was 67 years of age and unmarried. His nephew, Mr E. J. Burder, lived with him, and the Vicar of Bedminster is another nephew. The deceased was a man of high character, and there were few who were more universally esteemed, and consequently his death will be lamented by a very large circle of friends. Only last Thursday Dr Burder delivered a lecture before the Bristol Naturalists' Society. He retained the position of Consulting Surgeon at the General Hospital up to the time of his death.",
13/10/1893,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr John Frederick Lucas,"DEATH OF ALDERMAN LUCAS\r\n\r\nThe announcement of the death of Alderman J. F. Lucas, which took place yesterday, at his residence, Ponsford, will occasion much surprise, as well as widespread regret, as Mr Lucas was present at the meeting of the Town Council on Tuesday, and apparently in his usual health. It appears that on reaching home that evening he was seized with a sudden faintness, and on Wednesday the illness was of so serious a nature that Dr. E. Long Fox was called upon to visit the patient. In the evening he was reported to be slightly better, but inquiries made yesterday morning elicited replies which caused considerable anxiety, and between three and four o'clock it became known that a telegram had been received by relatives in Bristol conveying the news that the Alderman had passed away. Mr Lucas had suffered from Bright's disease, but we understand that death was due to an affection of the heart. The deceased was about 62 years of age, having been born on the night of the Bristol riots. He was head of the firm of Lucas Brothers, and Co., African merchant, of this city, and was a director of Daniel Sykes and Co, Limited. He had been an alderman of the city since 1868. He rarely took part in discussions in the Council; but he was always recognised as a man of sound judgment and good business ability. He served on the Watch Committee, and was also a member of the Committee of Visitors at the Lunatic Asylum, and he has been a justice of the peace for the city for many years. Deceased leaves a widow, one son - Mr E. C. Lucas, a partner in the business - and five daughters, one of whom was recently married to Mr Alan McArthur. Formerly Mr Lucas lived at Stapleton, but he resided for many years at 111 Pembroke Road, afterwards removing to Yatton, and about two years ago he took a residence at Ponsford.",
20/04/1891,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Walter Macliver,"The death of Mr Macliver removes from among the older citizens of Bristol one who has been closely associated with works of local progress, and whose energy was largely devoted during the generation which is passing to the maintenance and development of national interests. The columns of this journal, of which he was the founder, and to the time of his death the proprietor, are scarcely the place in which to attempt to portray those qualities of mind and heart which gave him a special position among his contemporaries and secured for him the affectionate regard of those who knew him best. The pen which has to record his death in the journal in which he was so long interested is subject to so many restraints as to deprive it of the  freedom in which a natural desire to eulogise without exaggeration would wish to indulge. The acknowledgment of his deserts as a citizen, and as a politician, must come from others. But while this task must be delegated to those who are acquainted with Mr Macliver's career as a journalist and member of Parliament, it will outrage no canon of modesty if the writer of this note lays upon his bier a simple wreath as a token of purely personal esteem. In a large city men may come and men may go, but the community goes on forever; and each generation builds its own monument in the works it leaves behind. Although it is true, as Robert Browning has finely said, that it is not what a man does that exalts him, but what a man would do, the public measure of capacity is usually to be found in the work actually achieved; and if Mr Macliver's claim to remembrance were to be estimated in this way it is probable that he would not receive that full justice to which the dissemination of influence would entitle him. The daily journal which he established in the summer of 1858 has been issued on upwards of ten thousand separate days, and every day it has recorded incidents which in the aggregate constitute local and national history. The ideal newspaper has not yet been published; but it can be truly said for Mr Macliver that his earnest wish was that the papers he controlled should contribute something towards the elevation and entertainment of possible readers, and that they should be as free from objectionable features as careful supervision could make them. It was a proud satisfaction to him that at a period when the provincial newspaper press was in a transition state, and when to start a daily journal was to incur a great risk, he established an organ that for the first time gave the city reports of the debates in Parliament on the preceding evening, and that provided a medium for daily communication. A second source of satisfaction to him was that he was able to find employment for a large number of men. To these pleasures he added consciousness that he was helpful to movements which he believed to be useful either to the district in which he lived or to the nation. If this were the place to record them, innumerable instances could be given of his generosity; and of his urbanity, his consideration for others, and his abnegation of himself, those who knew him intimately will not need to be reminded. He had confidence in the future of Bristol, and he believed that the past thirty years have laid a groundwork of great promise. The work he did is not evanescent; and this is one of the consolations which come to us when the Great Reconciler Death, withdraws those who most deserve our love, and whose absence seems to leave a void that cannot be filled.",
29/09/1919,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr Thomas Holmes Gore,"We regret to announce the death of Mr Thomas Holmes Gore, for very many years Clerk to the Bristol Justices, and who passed away on Saturday night at his residence, 4 Windsor  Terrace, Clifton. He was 83 years of age, and had been in failing health for some time. It was  in April 1875, that Mr T. Holmes Gore was appointed to the important post of Clerk to the Bristol Justices, whose choice was soon fully justified. He was already experienced in the work, having been Clerk to the Margate Justices from 1860 to 1865, and afterwards for ten years assistant clerk to the Lord Mayor of London in the justices' room at the Mansion House. The office of clerk to the Bristol Justices was created under the provisions of the Municipal Corporation Act, 1835, and of May in the following year Messrs William Brice and Daniel Burges, jun, were appointed Clerks to the Justices for the City and County of Bristol. Those gentlemen were also solicitors to the corporation; and by a subsequent arrangement in March, 1849, Mr Burges, on being appointed Town Clerk, resigned, and Mr Wm. Brice became sole clerk at a salary of Â£1000 a year. That office he held until April, 1875, when Mr T. Holmes Gore was appointed, Mr Brice becoming Town Clerk.\r\nIn May, 1910, when he had completed 40 years in Bristol, Mr Holmes Gore made a statement to a 'Daily Press' reporter as to the remarkably changes that had taken place in regard to the work of the Police Court. He pointed out that in some directions the business of the Clerk to the Justices department had materially increased, and the nature of some of the duties of the Clerk had become more difficult and involved. On the other hand, Mr Gore pointed out with satisfaction to the fact that during his period of office the crime of the city as reflected in the Police Court returns, had considerably decreased. His Majesty's Judges and the Recorder, when holding assizes and quarter sessions, frequently referred to the absence of serious crime in the calendars. Mr Gore was in the position to speak with the authority born of long experience of Bristol's Bench of unremunerated Magistrates, and he bore witness to the zealous and painstaking care with which those gentlemen carried out their responsible duties. The introduction of various new statutes and the increasing population of the city added at various times to the duties of the Magistrates' office, and Mr Gore acknowledged the great help he received from the then assistant clerk (the late Mr J. E. Braithwaite), as well as Messrs Esbester, Young, Grundy, and other members of staff. The passing of numerous Acts of Parliament from time to time made the duties of a justices' clerk more and more exacting and responsible, both in regard to criminal and licensing matters, but Mr Gore was always able to solve knotty problems that arose, and the remarkable scarcity of appeals from the decisions of the Bench was a splendid tribute to the sound advice they received from their clerk. Early in 1916, owing to his advancing years, Mr Holmes Gore was relieved of a great part of his responsibility and work by the appointment of Mr. W. S. George as joint clerk to the justices, but Mr Gore continued to perform a portion of his duties, and was at the offices fairly recently. His total record of work covers no less a period than 59 years, of which he had spent 44 in Bristol. \r\nMr Holmes Gore had three sons, of whom one is the Rev. G. H. Gore, a Church of England clergyman, who received special mention for his services as a chaplain in the forces. Mr Arthur Holmes Gore, a popular member of the theatrical profession, made the supreme sacrifice in the war.",
8/12/1894,Western Daily Press,Obituary,Mr. C. W. Savage,"SUDDEN DEATH OF MR C. W. SAVAGE\r\n\r\nWe regret to announce the sudden death, at his residence, Springfield, Westbury-on-Trym, of Mr C. W. Savage. The sad event was first discovered by the butler, who, on going to his late master's room, as usual, at 7.45 yesterday morning, found that, instead of being already dressed, as was often the case, the deceased gentleman was still in bed. A nearer view revealed the sad fact that life was extinct. Mr H. Ormerod, the medical advisor, was immediately summoned, and expressed the opinion that the deceased had died in his sleep very soon after retiring to rest. As it is well known that he had for some time suffered from heart disease, an inquest will probably be considered unnecessary. The death of Mr Savage removes from the parish one of its best known and oldest inhabitants. In every movement which he considered was for the good of the parishioners he ever took a prominent and energetic part. The Girls' School at Westbury, and the new Mission Room at Southmead, are two of the local monuments to the generosity with which he sacrificed both his time and his wealth. During the last few weeks of his life Mr Savage was engaged in securing a site for a Parish Institute, and though he met with several disappointments, he persevered, with the result that the current number of the Parish Magazine contains the announcement that a permanent building would shortly be erected. The paragraph further says:- 'The origination of this plan is entirely due to Mr C. W. Savage, who is always so ready and willing to advance all church work, both here and elsewhere'. The truth of the concluding sentences of the extract is abundantly proved by reference to the subscription lists of the Bristol Bishopric Scheme, the Cathedral Restoration Fund, and the numerous charitable institutions of many a Bristol parish. Mr Savage was a J.P. for the county of Gloucester and frequently attended the sitting of the court at Lawford's Gate. He was also chairman of the local Conservative Association, and took great interest in the Primrose League, a local habitation of which he had assisted to establish in the parish. He was one of the candidates nominated on Tuesday evening last for election on the Parish Council, and on that occasion he proposed a vote of thanks to the chairman. Mr Savage took a very active part in the negotiations which have been carried on for the purpose of avoiding a contest in the forthcoming election, and it is, indeed, said that his death has been hastened by overwork in connection with that and other parochial matters. On Thursday night Mr Savage arrived at the lodge at the entrance to Springfield, and when the gardener's wife came to open the gate, the deceased gentleman made kindly inquiries as to her health, and, knowing she had a bad cold, he requested her to return to the house, while he got out of his carriage and attended to the gate himself. This incident shows the thoughtful kindness of the elate master of Springfield, and as an illustration of the statement made by one of the household, 'We have lost a good master'. Mr Savage's brother died in 1891.",
